certified raw cow s milk goat s milk sheep or even horse s milk All will make cheese each with its unique flavor Cheese from unpasteurized milk should be cured for 2 4 months if there is any doubt about pathogens in the milk If you use pasteurized milk you may need to add a little calcium chloride to firm up the curd see below Cheese can be made from whole milk 3 5 2 or from skimmed milk However remember that the richness of flavor of the cheese is related to the amount of butterfat in the milk I do not recommend reconstituted powdered milk Let me know if you do You should get 1 to 1 5 pounds of cheese gallon of milk For store bought milk because Pasteurization removes calcium from solution you may need to add a small amount of calcium chloride to aid coagulation and form curd which does not fall apart when you stir it The desired concentration of CaCl2 is usually specified as 0 02 This would mean adding 3 6g CaCl2 to 5 gal of pasteurized milk My measurements indicate that 3 6g of crystals 3 4 tsp Thus 3 4 tsp crystals 5 gal 0 02 You should completely dissolve the CaCl2 in about 1 4 cup water before adding it to the milk Add it slowly with thorough stirring You should be able to purchase CaCl2 at brewer s supply house Also it is the non NaCl deicer that is plant friendly You might be able to use CaSO4 plaster of Paris in a highly diluted state tho it is much less soluble than CaCl2 Reconstituted powdered milk I have not had good luck using powdered milk but have heard some say that they have successfully used it I suggest you make friends with a local dairy person to get bulk milk You will have better luck getting milk from homesteaders than with commercial operators Legally you must purchase it as pet milk Ultrapasterurized milk This is common on the shelves in Europe but I find it VERY unsatisfying in taste and in my opinion this milk is nearly worthless in making basic cheese The protein strucure is radically altered and calcium is chelated so that it is unavailable for coagulation If you have success with ultrapasterized milk let us know You CAN use it to make yogurt and labneh Starter Bacteria must be added to acidify the milk so that the rennet will work and to aid in the curing Cultured buttermilk can serve as a mesophilic starter it likes room temperature and yogurt can serve as a thermophilic starter it prefers warmer temperatures You can also purchase pure cultures from cheese makers supply houses Some recipes call for addition of chemical acids to produce acidify the milk I prefer the flavor of cheese made from bacterially acidified milk Here is a detailed description of bacterial cheese starters from Peter Moller Be aware that especially with buttermilk you should never add too much starter for too long a time such that the milk has even remotely thickened before you add rennet With even slightly thickened milk you will never get a clean break Rennet An enzyme rennin converts milk protein casein from a soluble to an insoluble material causing the milk to gel forming a clean break It will only work well in acidified milk The gelling process must be undisturbed to get a clean break Rennet is commonly available in supermarkets in the pudding section or you can purchase liquid rennet from a cheese makers supply house One tablet of Junket rennet is equivalent to 20 drops of fresh liquid rennet If you would like to try it and have the materials available I have successfully prepared home made rennet from the abomasum of a suckling kid EQUIPMENT Most decently equipped kitchens have the necessary equipment Heavy stainless steel pot with lid A non reactive pot is important because the acidifying milk can dissolve aluminum Enamel pots would work as well A heavy bottom is important to evenly disperse the heat and prevent scorching Scorching affects the flavor and is a cleanup hassle The size of the pot should be large enough so that you have at least an inch of head space above the milk A cover is needed for the steps when the milk must sit for periods of time I bought a high quality five gallon pot like this years ago expensive I have never been sorry Measuring cups You may need measuring cups ranging from 1 4 cup to a quart Obviously you can improvise but accurate measurements improve your success rate Measuring spoons are occasionally needed Thermometer An accurate thermometer which reads in the range of 32 225 F 0 100 C is very important A candy or meat thermometer can work There are several reasons that accurate temperature is important the texture of the cheese depends a great deal on achieving a temperature to within one degree Also after milk for yogurt is scalded it must be cooled to 130 F for optimum bacteria action Whisk Thorough mixing of starter and rennet is important A whisk is the obvioius choice for this step Cheese cloth The purpose of cheese cloth is to catch the curd and allow the whey to drain out What most people think of as cheese cloth the very wide weave flimsy material is often useless for this purpose If your curd is fine it passes through Even if it is large curd the curd can become enmeshed in the coarse weave I use either large plain white cotton handkercheifs or white non terry cotton dish towels I recommend ignoring what is sold as cheese cloth Cheese press is required for the hard cheeses You can purchase them for a handsome price or fashion one from materials at home step by step directions for a series of cheeses, easy to more challenging"",""url"":""biology clc uc edu fankhauser Cheese Cheese course

imaginable and ardent fans of gustatory pleasures big and small are no exception When it comes to food the idea depository features lectures from a wide variety of experts weighing in on everything from environmental concerns to biology to ethics to sociology to economics and all that sits between All of these lectures cater to the passionate foodie who pines to learn all he or she can about the meals in front of them For them taste comprises only a fraction of the appeal and TED will not disappoint Marcel Dicke Why not eat insects Many Americans may cringe at the thought of crunching down on crickets but in reality insects are a popular protein packed snack enjoyed worldwide Incorporating them more and more into meals and snacks also appeals to the eco conscious concerned about sustainability issues It will take some time to convince many demographics of all the advantage of eating insects but Marcel Dicke works tirelessly to promote their validity as a nutritious ecologically sound food source Carolyn Steel How food shapes our cities One architect delves into the heavy influence that infrastructure holds over food distribution and vice versa With so many individuals flocking to urban areas the way meat and other agricultural products are raised will directly impact the environment most notably in the rainforest acreage cleared for cattle farms Foodies need to understand more than just appreciating amazing tastes and textures They must also put forth the effort to learn about the whos hows and whys behind how such meals make it to the table Some of the details may surprise them Peter Reinhart on Bread Such a simple staple inspires sensuous feelings especially when baked fresh and served warm with jam homemade butter or a favorite flavored oil and herbs Any foodies who enjoy sinking their teeth into a comforting slice of bread will love watching Peter Reinhart wax philosophical on what it means to him personally and how loaves have come to shape history and the culinary arts alike The more scientifically minded should pay close attention to his talk of how he developed a recipe based on epoxy s characteristics and ensured its edibility and quality Louise Fresco on feeding the whole world Another rumination on the role bread plays in diet and society alike this time peering into how mass production techniques may not be as evil and destructive as many believe Memetics history economics health and agriculture combine into one enlightening lecture wrought with heavy questions regarding how bread directly relates to each topic For example many rural bakers in poorer communities could adapt some of the production and distribution protocols associated with Wonderbread and its ilk without compromising on quality Doctors link its carbohydrate content to obesity especially as it became more affordable A fascinating talk with many provocative statements to stimulate the more philosophical epicures out there Barton Seaver Sustainable seafood Let s get smart Some aficionados of all things oceanic struggle with resigning their love of fish and shellfish with environmental concerns Noshing on the sea s bounty seriously taxes one of the planet s most delicate ecosystems but there may be a workable strategy for changing that Consumers concerned about their global impact should stick with heartier species with rapid reproduction rates They should reduce the amount of seafood in their diet reserving it for more special occasions and stick with smaller portions Salads make for a healthy side to help foodies safely fill up when their main proteins shrink Making economical decisions does not have to mean complete abstinence from a beloved tuna or oyster dish but one must stay mindful of ecology as well should they hope to continue their indulgence Dan Barber s foie gras parable Foie gras elicits so much controversy many countries and regions have outright banned its production The process involves the force feeding of geese and ducks to artificially swell their livers for consumption which more than understandably raises considerable questions regarding animal rights Dan Barber s incredibly intriguing lecture brings viewers to Eduardo Sousa s farm in Spain for a glimpse at how he produces rich foie gras without resorting to any ethically sketchy means All of the ducks and geese he raises eat of their own free will rather than having humans shove obscene amounts of grain down their gullets They wander around his expansive properly gorging themselves on the figs grass olives and other delights available for their taking This leads to the beloved fatty texture cherished by foodies using a completely natural methodology and the fowl are slaughtered shortly after their fall binges to maximize quality and yield Christien Meindertsma How pig parts make the world turn After pigs goes to slaughter they find their way way to more than just kitchens around the world Some end up in roughly 185 different consumer and medical products including soap heart transplants bullets cigarette filters bone china paint and paintbrushes This number also includes foodstuffs such as gelatin that many people don t realize also contains bits of pig and other animals While this doesn t exactly paint a perfect portrait of Fergus Henderson s nose to tail philosophy of eating many foodies may find the versatility of this overlooked barnyard denizen a fascinating study Less of everyone s porcine pals goes to waste than one would generally think though an appreciation for sampling the nasty bits as Anthony Bourdain calls them is never a bad thing to develop either Ann Cooper talks school lunches Truly loving the culinary arts means cultivating an understanding and appreciation of its importance on all levels not just the fine dining only afforded to fewer and fewer individuals as per the unfortunate stereotype School lunches for example have provoked the ire of many a parent concerned with the unhealthy levels of carbohydrates sugars and fats heaped on their children daily Their understanding and appreciation of food led them to fight for healthier options and renegade lunch ladies such as Ann Cooper joined them in providing fresh local nutritious and even educational meals Benjamin Wallace on the price of happiness Although most of this lecture revolves around food and beverage products its core message resonates to many different audiences Thanks to the snobberies of many an elitist diner foodies have a popular reputation of caring only for expensive trendy dishes by the most prestigiously trained chefs and many unfortunately feel the need to perpetuate this viewpoint True aficionados of the culinary arts know that even a humble street cart vendor can yield spectacular finds and seek out quality in all its myriad forms rather than limiting themselves to expensive eats Sadly though the industrialized world s obsession with status and money has led to a strange psychological phenomenon where people can actually talk themselves into enjoying a cheap wine just by being told it cost a much more exorbitant price It s a fascinating humbling and wholly necessary study to explore William Li Can we eat to starve cancer By this point most people who care even one iota about their health knows that maintain a nutritious diet reduces their risk of contracting certain cancers later in life Not everyone though can understandably cite the biological workings that allow this to happen William Li explains the hows and whys behind angiogenesis and diet s intimate relationship with cancer prevention Michael Pollan gives a plants eye view The author of The Omnivore s Dilemma and The Botany of Desire among plenty of other ruminations on food pulls from his research and passion to deliver an excellent insightful look at the world from a simultaneously alien and familiar perspective Plenty of people know what life looks like through the eyes of the animals they nosh upon yet they rarely take the time to really understand plants perhaps due to their relatively stationary nature This is rather unfortunate as taking the time to gauge the shape of things from their point of view casts meals and snacks in an entirely revelatory light Mark Bittman on what s wrong with what we eat American diets come packed with an overabundance of meat at the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables and too much reliance on restaurant food that comes crammed with salts carbohydrates and calories Though convenient and delicious such eating habits place the populace at an increased risk of heart disease cancer diabetes and other health hazards But they also negatively impact other nations as well since many of the production methods utilized in meeting American demands damage the environment and dip heavily into the world s overall food supply Jennifer 8 Lee hunts for General Tso Chinese food has become fully engrained in American cuisine yet almost all of the most popular dishes are nowhere to be found in the original country Journalist Jennifer 8 Lee engages viewers in history lessons explaining how one of the most familiar forms of fusion food in the States popped into existence This is a must watch for all culinary aficionados with a particular affinity for learning the myriad ways in which cultures merge and produce curious new flavors inspired by different palates and traditions Graham Hill Why I m a weekday vegetarian Not everyone can or wants to pull off a fully vegetarian or vegan diet yet they d still like to enjoy the health environmental and financial benefits The weekday vegetarian movement allows them to indulge their not so inner carnivore while simultaneously reducing their expenditures and ecological impact and boosting their overall wellness It strikes the right balance for those who find an exclusively meatless eggless and dairy less intake far too limiting Malcolm Gladwell on spaghetti sauce One jar of spaghetti sauce comes packaged with a hundred different stories about the people involved the ingredients cultivated and the research that goes into picking the perfect components and the perfect process creating a perfect offering Even beyond this though it also serves as an unexpectedly apt conduit for broader philosophies regarding contentment and the nature of choice An excellent TED Talk for the foodies who enjoy using their passion to raise larger questions about life the universe and everything Paul Stamets on 6 ways mushrooms can save the world Fungi of all shapes and sizes end up on plates at cheap delicious mom and pop diners and the trendiest of upscale bistros alike and everything in between But this intrepid mycologist points out how mushrooms do more than just add a lovely earthy flavor to soups salads and meats They play an integral role in keeping the environment as safe and healthy as possible and have been widely cultivated for their medicinal properties Without them both humanity and the planet it inhabits would not possess the ability to function properly If at all Heribert Watzke The brain in your gut Eating well transcends the merely sensual it also involves complex metabolic processes extending long after that carnitas taco grew into a grey masticated wad of cornmeal pork and saliva Believe it or not the hundreds of thousands of neurons lining the digestive tract mostly if not exclusively in the intestines that play a heavy role in defining eating habits Understanding them enhances the mind body connection so lovingly cultivated by foodies but it also helps scientists and chefs alike use the culinary arts to formulate the perfect meals taking full advantage of the body s potential Arthur Potts Dawson A vision for sustainable restaurants Another TED Talk delving into how the world s eating habits directly affect the surrounding environments Beyond the production facilities restaurants themselves have taken up sustainable practices when it comes to whipping up and serving meals Not only do they patronize more eco friendly vendors they also take to composting rigging their buildings to utilize alternative energy sources recycling encouraging nose to tail dining and much more Barry Schuler Genomics 101 Controversy abounds over genetically modified foods with both sides creating compelling arguments for and against its agricultural incorporation Epicures desiring to learn all they can about the origins of their favorite meals would do well to research what different experts have to say on the subject looking at both sides before formulating a cogent opinion This lecture by Barry Schuler offers up one perspective to consider explaining the genomics process and the positive impact it has on the food supply He uses pinot noir grapes to illustrate these points Adam Grosser and his sustainable fridge Some clever developers have found a way to manipulate existing technology familiar in homes across the industrialized world in order to bring refrigeration to isolated areas many of them lacking reliable electricity Not only will they help prevent terrible spoilage and waste they power themselves using

and gas pain digestive enzyme supplement for today s stressful lives and poor diets What it is No Bloat is the best digestive enzyme supplement you can buy It is a carefully crafted blend of 18 specialized digestive enzymes No Bloat contains enzymes that work both in the stomach and the intestines improving digestion through the entire process to help relieve gas and stomach bloating Each enzyme has a separate role in the long chain of events that must take place before food is fully broken down into small enough particles to be available for nutrient absorption Properly broken down food will nourish and fuel the body Poorly digested food will poison and bog the body down robbing you of nutrients and energy creating unhealthy conditions throughout the body and causing abdominal bloating gas pain and flatulence Why do so many people have digestion problems today Because our modern farmed and processed foods have becoming increasingly devoid of enzymes making it dead food Irradiated fruits vegetables and meats plus meals loaded with preservatives and chemicals that are then cooked to death simply do not have the enzymes nature intended us to have in our foods Food processors can add back the vitamins that are lost in foods but they can t add enzymes because the preservatives processing and cooking kill the natural enzymes No Bloat is the sensible solution to today s digestion problems which plague so many because No Bloat replaces the enzymes that are lost in modern food production No Bloat is all natural and completely plant based there are no cheap animal based enzymes in No Bloat and no fillers The 18 different enzymes in No Bloat help ensure the complete breakdown of your meals by providing enzymes targeted to every food group helping your

to be bloated all the time whether you have eaten or not then you owe it to yourself to experience the relief that enzymes natures perfectly designed digestion miracles can offer you You have nothing to lose as No Bloat comes with a 100 money back guarantee Read Reviews What it does Enzymes break down the foods we eat and drinks we drink No digestion could take place without them The more enzymes your body has available to it the better your digestion will be In order to experience gas and bloat free digestion of meals food must pass quickly and efficiently through our digestive systems Stomach acid will not digest your food by its self enzymes must be present for proper digestion to take place When the body has too little enzymes available because our foods are dead the body compensates by adding more digestive acid which can lead to gas bloating and acid reflux Without enough digestive enzymes food can sit in the stomach too long and contribute to bloating If there are not sufficient enzymes available in the intestines then poorly digested food that passes from the stomach can linger too long in the intestines and start to rot and ferment setting off a bad chain reaction that can cause all manner of maladies on top of extreme gas and abdominal bloating This poorly digested food will eventually pass into the colon where it will continue to rot and ferment giving off large amounts of gasses which cause abdominal bloating flatulence cramps gas pain and even constipation or diarrhea and an overall unhealthy feeling This is why bloating can seem like it s just occurring in the stomach or often times it feels as if the entire abdominal region is bloated because there are bloat causing problems occurring in the stomach intestines and colon No Bloat replaces the enzymes we would normally get from healthy raw foods helping to restoring digestion efficiency to the entire digestive tract Many people get tired and fatigued after eating An unhealthy digestive system is easily overloaded and a meal without sufficient enzymes is very difficult to digest When your body has to expend too much energy on digestion you experience fatigue Enzymes help the body digest food more efficiently and quickly reducing the energy the body needs to spend on digestion and giving us more energy for day to day activities What it costs and how to buy it Click here or visit the Order Products page in the menu above and you will see how you can get special discounts and buy two bottles get one free specials More information on No Bloat Modern food production and processing has greatly reduced enzymes levels in our foods via four major processes Depleted farm soils requiring artificial fertilizers and pesticides Irradiating of fruits vegetables and meats Pasteurization of dairy products Cooking and Microwaving of foods The foods humans once ate were rich in enzymes that assisted digestion Modern farming has left our soils depleted of the enzymes we should be getting in our food Once farm soils have lost their natural enzyme and nutrient level farmers add chemical fertilizers on top of that they add damaging pesticides Also fruits and vegetables are often irradiated which further reduces essential enzymes in our food Even some meats are irradiated Pasteurization destroys the enzymes and beneficial bacteria in the dairy products we consume One of the reasons people who live in unspoiled areas living off the land eating healthy natural raw foods have far fewer instance of digestive problems is that they have a diet naturally abundant in enzymes Fruits and vegetables grown in healthy natural soil are rich in enzymes unpasteurized milk and cheese products are also rich in enzymes Modern farmed fruits and vegetables and our pasteurized dairy products unfortunately are very lacking in enzymes Aging has an effect on enzyme levels as well As we get older our body s ability to produce digestive enzymes is reduced It s no wonder why foods and drinks we once enjoyed without problems become intolerable when we start to get a bit older Supplementing your diet with natural plant based enzymes is a logical choice and remedy to combat digestive problems The 18 enzymes in No Bloat are so effective and the benefits so broad you will not want to eat a meal without it We are so confident that you will be delighted and amazed with how well No Bloat works we offer a no risk 100 money back guarantee The great antacid conspiracy We all know our bodies well enough to know that indigestion gas and bloating are a product of poor digestion Yet modern habits and beliefs says we should wait until we get ugly and uncomfortable gas and bloating again and then pop Tums after Tums or prescription remedies knowing it will only give us brief relief we hope from the discomfort Tums Rolaids and Maalox type products treat the symptom and not the cause of gas and bloat Wouldn t it make more sense to improve your digestion and PREVENT gas and bloating But what options for relief do we have Not much until No Bloat was created Popping Tums often causes the condition to worsen A MAIN CAUSE OF POOR DIGESTION IS LOW STOMACH PH By taking antacids you hope to give yourself brief relief by reducing gas but you are also reducing your digestive acid level Proper acid levels are essential to complete digestion when you reduce those levels you create a situation where food cannot be properly broken down in the stomach which leads to You guessed it Gas Bloating and Indigestion Antacids are notorious for causing constipation and to make matters worse constipation further exaggerates bloating No Bloat is an all natural vegetarian digestive aid formula that never causes constipation like antacids The super wide range of digestive enzymes in NO BLOAT actually improve bowel movement function Of course some people do suffer from over production of acid and for them the natural roll enzymes play in proper digestion are just as important as they are to those with low acid levels No Bloat is very effective when taken with meals and can be used anytime to relieve gas and bloating in place of antacids and can even help with symptoms of GERD IBS and heart burn often producing much longer lasting relief Enzymes are not very well known by most of the human population yet but they absolutely work Most people s only experience with digestive enzymes is from trying Beano Many had poor or no relief and so gave up on enzymes The reason is that Beano contains just one enzyme alpha galactosidase No Bloat also contains alpha galactosidase PLUS 17 additional important enzymes Different enzymes work in different areas of the digestive system Some work best in the upper stomach others in the lower stomach while others work best in the intestines Enzymes are very specific in their role of breaking down food as well One enzyme will break down the food to certain components then others take over by breaking down those new components The more enzymes your body has available to it the better your digestion will be A proper blend of enzymes will assist the body with the entire process of breaking down any foods we may eat all the way to the fully digested state that our bodies need for gas and bloat free digestion proper absorption of nutrients and efficient bowel movements Agriculture uses enzyme blends to improve digestion in cattle Of course ranchers don t have their cows telling them how much better the enzymes make their tummies feel but they can see the benefits in the health of their animals and scientific studies prove it So why don t people use enzymes as commonly as antacids Dollar There is big big money in antacids heartburn relief chemicals and prescription remedies It s much more profitable selling band aids that treat the symptoms of a condition over and over for years than it is to prevent it No Bloat was developed to change this with a specific enzyme blend that helps prevent gas and bloat from becoming a problem Digestive enzymes are an important part of returning your digestive system to good health Many common illnesses have been traced to poor digestion and the resulting toxicity of the body and decreased nutrient absorption Many people report a host of very pleasant improvements in their bodies and lifestyle after they have corrected their digestive problems Everyone is different but don t be surprised to notice some or even many beneficial side effects including improvements in symptoms of depression fatigue Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS skin problems flatulence poor concentration and memory retention and excessive weight Good health begins with good digestion Next time you sit down to a meal that you know is going to give you a bloated belly or you start to get that painful gas or indigestion feeling reach for a No Bloat capsule instead of antacids and feel the revolution You can get healthy long lasting relief from the natural safe

drugs even if it was for a short time In the midst of an addiction it is easy to ignore the long term financial impact and justify the satisfaction of the psychological and physical urges It is hard to see the big picture sometimes on our own and depending upon the level and type of addiction apathy and pride can cause us to ignore consequences We hope that some of the figures below will help young people to see the financial impact of starting and promote a deeper inquiry into the real costs of addiction 1 Cocaine source The cost of cocaine has dramatically risen in the past two years According to USAToday the price of one pure gram of cocaine has increased by 47 since 2006 selling for 137 for one gram A cocaine addict can easily spend upward of 100 per day on cocaine or 36 400 per year Cocaine users prioritize the euphoric experience and place the purchase of the drug over much else such as paying rent bills food etc The euphoric feelings take precedent and can mask any financial worries causing the habit to be seemingly affordable When powder cocaine is processed into crack 2 Methamphetamines source Along with cocaine costs rising Methamphetamine is proving to be one of the most expensive drugs on the street The going rate for one pure gram of Meth is around 245 which is a dramatic leap from 133 in 2006 Meth users may spend more than 1 000 per week resulting in expenditures of approximately 52 000 per year Methamphetamines are also known on the street as Ice Ecstasy or Speed One eight ball is 3 5 grams and can cost anywhere from 250 1 200 depending on the cut An average addict can go though one eight ball in two days 3 Alcohol source An addiction to alcohol can cost you financially and is the number one drug of choice since it is not illegal Non addicted adult social drinkers can spend 600 per month on alcohol An alcohol addict can spend 2 800 per month depending on the amount consumed For an alcoholic a night at the bar can be financially devastating with staggering subtotals When calculating the cost of alcohol legal expenses related to citations and criminal offenses lost productivity at work and a shorter lifespan one study\u00c2 http www spiritualriver com for alcoholics quitting drinking will net you over one million dollars concluded that the actual cost of alcohol addiction amounts to 37 300 year for each individual Most of the time crimes are committed by a person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol with consequences ranging from jail time to hefty fees A person convicted of driving under the influence will spend on average 5 540 on their DUI DWI fees 4 Marijuana source Marijuana is generally viewed as the least harmful drug It averages 20 per gram depending on the quality and type A person addicted to marijuana may use up to 94 joints per week or 13 joints a day which would cost 260 a week or 13 520 annually Designer marijuana strains like the White Widow strain contains a potent amount of THC which makes the bud white hence the name White Widow can cost 350 per ounce making for a very expensive habit 5 Prescription Painkillers source Using prescription medicines is costly especially if the user does not have an injury Prescription painkillers are around 15 per generic bottle of 20 pills with a prescription A painkiller user who just wants to get high usually pays more for street drugs Generally one s tolerance increases causing an increase in the drug to achieve the high effects Buying painkillers on the street can cost up to 20 per pill A person with a painkiller habit can use up to 70 pills per week which can cost 1 400 totaling 35 000 per year in many cases 6 Tobacco source According to a Duke University study by health economists the real cost of smoking was calculated at 40 per pack which includes the cost of the cigarettes and excise taxes increased insurance premiums medical expenses for the smoker and the family of the smoker and lost earnings due to disability By age 65 a pack a day smoker will have smoked half a million cigarettes Tobacco addiction has been compared to heroin addiction and is one of the toughest habits to quit Smokeless tobacco or dip costs around 4 per can or more depending on state taxes and to support the habit of 3 cans per week costs over 600 per year A pack a day smoker at 4 a pack spends over 1 400 Many people smoke in their

at Disneyland than any man in his early 30s should probably ever admit One of the main reasons for this is that the food is pretty exceptional and it seems like I make a new culinary discovery every time I go back That said it s high time I post an addendum to the list I crafted last year This time I ve broadened the scope to include food at Disney s California Adventure which sits directly across from Disneyland 10 Soft Serve Swirl Cone at Catch a Flave California Adventure image courtesy of byronface I m not a huge ice cream eater but the urge struck me just right one hot summer day and I indulged in a swirl cone And oh my goodness The ice cream was incredibly creamy and rich bordering on frozen custard it seemed 9 Lobster Nachos at Ariel s Grotto California Adventure image courtesy of byronface Whenever I order lobster nachos at a restaurant I usually have the same complaint too much chip not enough lobster Not the case here Ariel s Grotto piles on a surprisingly heavy helping of the crustacean and not a single chip goes unused 8 Chocolate Covered Peanut Butter Sandwich at Greetings from California California Adventure I haven t tried every confection at the sweets counter in California Adventure and I m sure plenty of them merit mention But the peanut butter sandwich is definitely a standout among what I have tried A thick creamy layer of peanut butter on a perfectly crisp cookie slathered in the ideal amount of chocolate Drool 7 Cobb Salad at Plaza Inn Disneyland I know what you re thinking I m shocked that there s a salad on this list too But if you ve ever had the Disneyland cobb salad you ll know why it s here And you ll also know that it s hardly the salad you order when you re watching your figure Mounds of cheese meat and goodness of all kinds tossed in a creamy blue cheese dressing with a breadstick on the side It s a staple in my Disneyland diet Plus if you don t feel like fighting the fireworks crowd at night you can buy a salad plop down in the Plaza Inn s ample seating area and enjoy a decent view of the exploding night sky above the hedges that line the restaurant s patio 6 Bleu Cheese and Wine Pairing at Terrace Wine Tasting California Adventure I don t know much about wine but I love listening to people who do And the staff at the Terrace Wine Tasting bar at California Adventure certainly seems to know its stuff The bleu cheese and red wine pairing was a lot of fun The cheeses delicious in their own right were paired perfectly with their red wine counterparts And I had a Disney cast member on hand the whole time to walk me through what I was tasting and explain why it all worked so well together 5 Jumbo Rice Krispie Treat at Greetings from California California Adventure Much like the peanut butter sandwich you just have to eat one to understand And I recommend you do Never has a more sublime krispie to mallow ratio been achieved 4 Cheddar Broccoli Soup in a Bread Bowl at Pacific Wharf Caf\u00e9 California Adventure The soup is quite good But you order it for the bread bowl which is phenomenal How can it not be when it was just pulled out of the oven at the Boudin bakery next door 3 Free Fresh Tortilla at the Mission Tortilla Factory California Adventure The brief tour at the Mission Tortilla Factory at California Adventure is cute and it s worth doing once So why have I done the tour more than an estimated two dozen times Because of the free fresh off the conveyor belt tortilla at the end of course And come on how many things at a theme park are free 2 Fried Chicken Dinner at Plaza Inn Disneyland I owe this discovery to a friend She wouldn t stop talking about the chicken dinner at the Plaza Inn and I finally gave it a try just to shut her up But man she was right It s not just good because it s fried chicken It s good fried chicken You win again Disneyland And the fireworks view I mentioned with the cobb salad applies here too 1 Family Style Barbecue Feast at Big Thunder Ranch Barbecue Disneyland One of Disneyland s newest dining options is also one of its most noteworthy Dinner at the ranch is a family style all you can eat extravaganza of barbecue chicken and ribs smoked sausages cole slaw baked beans corn on the cob and cornbread It comes at a price a few bucks shy of 30 a person but the food is good the setting is rustic and relaxing and there s no loophole to the all you can eat clause Before we even touched our meal my friend demanded an extra bucket filled exclusively with ribs And our waitress happily obliged that time as well as several other times during the course of our dinner as i confessed in my earlier post, \u201ctop 10 best foods at disneyland,\u201d i spend more time at disneyland than any man in his early 30s should probably ever blog

individuals living in a controlled setting who were randomized to overconsumption of different levels of protein diets those consuming the low protein diet had less weight gain compared to those consuming normal and high protein diets and calories alone and not protein appeared to contribute to an increase in body fat according to a study in the January 4 issue of JAMA The researchers also found that protein did contribute to changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass Obesity has become a major public health concern with more than 60 percent of adults in the United States categorized as overweight and more than 30 percent as obese according to background information in the article The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation is unclear George A Bray M D of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge La and colleagues conducted a study to determine whether the level of dietary protein differentially affected body composition weight gain or energy expenditure under tightly controlled conditions The randomized controlled trial included 25 U S healthy weight stable male and female volunteers ages 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30 The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007 After consuming a weight stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days participants were randomized to receive diets containing 5 percent of energy from protein low protein 15 percent normal protein or 25 percent high protein which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10 to 12 week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period the protein diets provided approximately 40 percent more energy intake which corresponds to 954 calories a day All participants in the study gained weight and there were no differences by sex The rate of weight gain in the low protein diet group was significantly less than in the other 2 groups 6 97 lbs 3 16 kg vs 13 3 lbs 6 05 kg for the normal protein diet group and 14 4 lbs 6 51 kg in the high protein diet group Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the excess stored calories Resting energy expenditure total energy expenditure and body protein did not increase during

a normal protein diet 15 percent of energy from protein with the same number of extra calories Calories alone however contributed to the increase in body fat In contrast protein contributed to the changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass but not to the increase in body fat the researchers write The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while

While Protein Increases Lean Mass In an accompanying editorial Zhaoping Li M D Ph D and David Heber M D Ph D of the University of California Los Angeles write that the results of this study informs primary care physicians and policy makers about the benefits of protein in weight management The results suggest that overeating low protein diets may increase fat deposition leading to loss of lean body mass despite lesser increases in body weight Policy makers and primary care physicians need to understand the role of the Western diet in promoting overweight and obesity Because this diet increases the risks of overnutrition through fat deposition beyond that detected by body mass index the method used to assess the current obesity epidemic and the magnitude of the obesity epidemic may have been underestimated Clinicians should consider assessing a patient s overall fatness rather than simply measuring body weight or body mass index and concentrate on the potential complications of excess fat accumulation The goals for obesity treatment should involve fat reduction rather than simply weight loss along with a better understanding of nutrition science JAMA 2012 307 1 86 87

is not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination When I was a child we attended a Methodist church While in high school we went to a Baptist hellfire and brimstone \u00c2 Church My mother still goes there I stopped the day I turned 18 it was kind of an unspoken\u00c2 agreement between myself and my mother I wish she d stop going and come to her senses about the bullshit this guy spews \u00c2 I wasn t ever Baptized but I consider myself to be affluent in the beliefs of the church and all opposing viewpoints Let s just say this on my census form \u00c2 I put Jedi These two parents especially the mother need to be jailed At the very least her\u00c2 three other children need to be put under protective custody Why She cost this little girl her life because she trusted her imaginary friend more than she trusted a doctor she could see converse with and touch If this lady would have told the press she didn t take her child to the doctor because Satan told her not to we d have her ass institutionalized But since it was attributed to God and God is associated with light and goodness it s okay because her intentions were in the right place What s the difference Some of the worst fuckups in the history of mankind were based on good intentions and blind faith If you need them pointed out you re a fucking fool I will admit that people have been dying of Diabetic Ketoacidosis for thousands of years If this little girl would have been born in 1897 rather than 1997 she would have died in her home all the same The family would have prayed and she would have died The issue here surrounds the fact that it s 2008 Medical science has increased the life expectancy of a white female to nearly 80 years which is far more than 11 But the thing that solidifies that this bitch needs jailed is that several family members had been trying to get her to take the child to the hospital for days and she prayed Other s common sense had taken hold over faith yet mommy s did not Daddy s did not That s because they are retarded A mother s common sense maternal instinct has to exist right Nay a HUMAN BEING S COMMON SENSE must exist right \u00c2 A child is suffering from

true We did learn one truth God does not replace Beta Cells upon special request maybe she needed a PA Some might say to me you are a faithless piece of shit I d kick your ass right now if I could

person with the very\u00c2 book that preaches in part about tolerance hope love and charity Christians have been fighting and killing in the name of God for well about 2 thousand years now I wouldn t expect much change anytime soon Especially now that we have some new sins to fight about Anyway I would challenge the above statement about myself I am not without faith hope or love tolerance of others I m working on it I hold that I have an abundance of all three I have faith in my abilities my Brothers my significant other the goodness of a stranger just to name a few I have unwaivering hope I always hope for better for others myself those in need want I have hope that the future is better than\u00c2 today I hope that our children learn from our mistakes and I have faith that we can raise them to meet that challenge Love one cannot work in the trenches without love Love for the patient seeking counsel or the cancer patient seeking relief and comfort Love for the person sleeping

month long observation from September 15th through October 15th It recognizes the contributions of Hispanic Americans and celebrates Hispanic heritage and culture in the United States In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month I ve asked Mexican American food blogger Gabriela Lopez of Gabriela s Kitchen to share one of her favorite recipes from her childhood As you will see her childhood memories in the kitchen have not only kept her connected to her culture but has greatly influenced her relationship with food and family My grandmother s gas stove had four burners and all four were always full On one she d simmer a huge pot of pinto beans on two others a pot of New Mexican green chile and another of red chile On the front burner she d flip flour tortillas on a hot comal or griddle and lovingly stack the hot handmade tortillas between a folded soft clean kitchen towels This was the meal I d look forward to with each weekly visit to my grandma Ida and grandpa Lorenzo s adobe home I learned how to clean beans at their kitchen table where it was my grandpa s job to remove the out of place pebbles and malformed frijoles The black shriveled broken and small beans got tossed aside Grandma would then rinse the plump freckled beans put them in a big pot with a few slices of bacon and place them atop the gas stove to cook for three hours Two and a half hours in she d add salt and simmer them for a half a hour more The end result was simple humble and soul filling My grandma Ida would let my brother and I help knead and roll out the dough for the tortillas Although ours weren t perfect round discs my grandma would cook them up on the comal My brother would eat his immediately while I was so proud that I d take it home and keep it until my mother convinced me that I would make one next week and I would sorrowfully toss away the stale tortilla We learned the importance of coming together as a family to create and share in a meal through these experiences as small children in the kitchen Allowing children to take on small tasks like cleaning beans or kneading and rolling out dough gives them the confidence and interest in cooking that will not only provide them with fond memories but also help them have a healthy and happy relationship with food for the rest of their lives photo credit Alex Uballez Homemade Tortillas the Way Grandma Made ThemRecipe by Gabriela Lopez Ingredients 4 cups all purpose flour or 2 cups white flour 2 cups whole wheat flour 2 Tbs baking powder 1 1 2 tsp salt 1 4 cup lard or vegetable shortening 1 cup 1 2 cup warm water Sift flour baking powder and salt together Cut in the lard or shortening until evenly dispersed the dough should feel more coarse and mealy Add 1 cup warm water and knead if dough is too dry add more water a tablespoon at a time until the dough is soft and pliable but not too sticky Knead for 3 minutes Form into a large ball and let rest for 1 2 hour in a floured bowl covered with a damp cloth Form into round balls about the size of a ping pong ball On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin roll dough into discs about 1 8 inches thick Cook on a preheated very hot griddle for about 30 seconds per side until golden brown speckles appear flipping only once Keep the tortillas warm by placing in a clean dry towel Store cooked tortillas in an airtight container in a cool dry

fruits and vegetables from the market Vegetarian Times produce primer: a refresher course in selecting the ripest, best-tasting fruits and vegetables from the market"",""body"":""Picking through produce is a pleasure for some But many are overwhelmed by the task of choosing that perfect fruit or vegetable from the pile judging its ripeness color and smell and trying to decide whether it should be refrigerated or not Too often that perfectly dyed waxed buffed and sprayed specimen turns out to be dry and flavorless However choosing ripe fruit and vegetables isn t just luck of the draw Whether you re stocking up your pantry or shopping for something succulent for a Labor Day picnic some general guidelines for buying ripe fruits and vegetables can help Most fruit tastes best softened at room temperature and eaten within a few days of purchase Once ripened it can be stored in a cool place such as the refrigerator where some varieties may keep for several weeks If you re in a hurry for it to be ripe that old hint about putting fruit in a brown paper bag really works The bag traps ethylene gas naturally released during ripening that helps soften the fruit Most fruit should not be kept in plastic bags because the plastic holds moisture which will cause mold to grow Most experts say washing produce with water is sufficient for cleaning especially if it is grown without pesticides Like fruit vegetables are best eaten within a few days of purchase and washed just before preparation But unlike fruit most vegetables should be wrapped tightly in plastic and stored in the refrigerator crisper Keep only vegetables in your crisper If they re sitting with fruit the ethylene gas from the fruit can cause premature brown spotting on the vegetables The flop and fuzz test is a good rule of thumb for determining ripeness According to the flop rule vegetables such as broccoli and lettuce heads that flop to one side when held vertically should probably be reserved for soup stock not eaten whole Flopping indicates lost moisture and flavor And if produce is covered with bluish gray fuzz toss it Do avoid fruits and veggies that are shriveled wrinkled bruised or gashed but don t be too swayed by appearance Organic produce grown regionally and without chemicals doesn t get waxed polished or dyed to hide cosmetic blemishes It often looks imperfect compared to its conventional counterparts but the flavor is vastly superior despite the apple s brown spots or the orange s green tinge Finally ask the produce manager for guidance He or she knows which fruits and vegetables are at their peak and will gladly help you make a selection FRUIT Apples To avoid mealy apples choose those that are firm to the touch and free of bruises or gashes Many think an intact stem is a good indicator of freshness but most varieties have their stems cut off so they don t puncture other apples during shipment Apples will keep for two to three weeks in the refrigerator In season August through December Apricots Apricots should be eaten when they are deep yellow to reddish orange in color which is probably why thousands of years ago the Persians called them eggs of the sun They should be plump and give slightly when squeezed Apricots can last in a fruit basket for two weeks and even longer in the refrigerator In season May through July Cherries There are many types of cherries ranging from dark purple to bright red sweet to tangy All should be plump and richly colored with stems intact The best eating cherries are crisp with flesh that clings to the pit When buying dark cherries look them over very carefully as the color can hide signs of decay or mold Cherries should be refrigerated immediately stored in a plastic bag and used within a couple of days In season July through August Berries Berries are popular during the summer and fall months but don t let your enthusiasm allow you to buy the first quart you see They taste best in mid to late summer When buying berries take a good look at the container If it s stained with juice chances are the berries sitting at the bottom are mushy or smashed Most varieties are easily damaged so remember you will probably never get a container with every berry in perfect condition Unlike most fruit berries should be refrigerated as soon as you get them home Before storing throw away those that are already damaged and put the rest in a flat container to avoid any further damage Use care when washing them Best May through August Blueberries Their smaller wild cousin has a lavender tinge but domestically grown blueberries are dark blue and have a silvery tinge Choose those that are plump and free of stems and leaves Blueberries can be stored in a sealed container and frozen Blackberries and Raspberries Should be purchased when plump and have inch color for their variety Look for blackberries that are black with a bright purplish tinge Most raspberries sold in the United States are red but some varieties are yellow purple or black Blackberries and raspberries are even more susceptible to damage than other berries so treat them with extra care when washing produce primer: a refresher

the few things that makes Monday mornings even more dreadful than they already are is when one has to rummage in the laundry hamper dig through the drawers and tear through the closet in order to piece together a superb outfit and make it on time to work or school As ideal as spending the previous night picking out and coordinating the perfect outfit sounds in our minds in reality most of us are either too busy or too tired to bother Yet most of us also refuse to or just can t opt for sloppy less snappy ensembles Photo Credits 1 2 3In light of the time crunch college students face a uniform might not be a bad thing No I don t mean a plaid skirt and collared top \u00e0 la Catholic schoolgirl but a general schema for how you dress every day Contrary to popular myth a uniform is not a sign of a lack of individuality or a lack of creativity After all Jacqueline Kennedy was known for her pillbox hats and tailored suits in the sixties Alexander Wang loves his cotton t shirts and dapper sneakers and Karl Lagerfeld is never without a sharp tie and a pair of black sunglasses Having a personal uniform saves time and relieves stress in the mornings and gives you a signature look that others will remember you by Tips for Creating Maintaining a Personal UniformCreating a personal uniform for yourself appears to be a daunting task at first but can save you time and gain you a lot of attention in the long run Start with these simple steps and work your way into slightly less stressful mornings and dashing style Take photos Invest in a Polaroid camera or just use the self timer on your digital camera to take photographs of your outfits in order to figure out what you like and don t like Figure out what your signature accessories are and stick with them Do you always wear a strand of pearls around your neck Do you have thirty pairs of tights and stockings that you always wear with skirts or dresses Make sure you have enough varieties of your signature piece to last you all week whether it s a collection of patent leather heels or giant cocktail rings Even if you decide to mix and match the rest of your outfit a signature item will reduce the time spent accessorizing and completing your outfit in the morning Make guidelines for each piece while still leaving a lot of flexibility into your uniform You can easily do this by naming or categorizing each component of your uniform for example a structured blazer an A line dress or straight jeans A structured blazer ensures that you re picking something work appropriate but is open to interpretation think about it what does structured exactly mean at the same time Choose your uniform components based on what looks best on you That includes only wearing trends that look good on you You re much less likely to change your entire style or wardrobe if you are already wearing what looks best on you Organize your closet and drawers based on pieces instead of colors or seasons That way even if you re half awake in the morning you can choose an outfit efficiently without frantically searching for a peacoat Think investment not disposable Disposable fast fashion can be fun but investing in high quality unique or classic pieces will eventually save you time and money That doesn t mean you need to sell your kidney in order to buy the latest Alexander McQueen collection but it does mean you should buy pieces that you know will last you a long time and that you will wear for a long time whether it s a pencil skirt from H M or a vintage Chanel 2 55 purse Having a personal uniform doesn t have to be dry at all It s time efficient consistently interesting and conceptually unique so you can spend less time rummaging through your closet and more time turning heads as you stride to work or school Looking for more inspiration Check out Sheena Matheiken on The Uniform Project where she wears the same dress every day for an entire year raising money for The Akanksha Foundation What do you

right in the post below NDP Ima tells you all about easy to make hard to stop eating pickles You ll see from her intro paragraph where I got my taste buds These pickles are salty tangy and really bright from the addition of fresh dill So read up then go make some pickles I am really not a salt lover I don t use much when I cook and in restaurants great food that s well seasoned is often too salty for my taste I don t care for chips or french fries and I prefer nuts spicy or au naturel Nonetheless I do love briny salty things olives capers and sour pickles So when I was leaving town for a long weekend and had a lot of small cucumbers that wouldn t last until my return I decided to try my hand at some pickles I wanted spicy garlicky dill pickles that would make themselves in the refrigerator while I was gone I remembered the ones a family friend used to make with cucumbers from his garden and my dad s He didn t use shortcuts though he put his pickles in huge crocks of brine and alum in the basement for weeks I cut the cukes into thick chunky slices and placed them in a quart jar with pickling spices and garlic I didn t have any fresh dill so my first batch just had dill seed from the pickling spice but it still tasted authentic I prepared the vinegar brine and filled the jar leaving it upside down on the counter overnight The next morning before rushing to the airport I put the jar in the frig When I returned four nights later the pickles were done to perfection The recipe below is really more of a method you can vary the ingredients and the size of your jars and your cucumbers will determine your quantities As long as you maintain the proportions of \u00be cup of vinegar and \u00bc cup of kosher salt per quart of boiled and cooled water your brine will work and you ll have great pickles in a matter of days Try this with green tomatoes if you have them in your garden with blanched cauliflower small sweet peppers or blanched pearl onions Add onions or hot peppers for extra kick I used just one hot pepper to enhance the spicy flavor I made a second batch with fresh dill sprigs blanched carrots and a few kalamata olives in addition to the cukes They re not quite finished as a I write this but they look so good I can t wait to sample them If you like sweet pickles instead of sour substitute sweet pickling spices cloves and allspice use cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and add sugar 1 2 cup to \u00be cup to your brine Your pickles will keep about four months in the refrigerator If you seal your finished pickle jars with a canning process they will keep on the shelf indefinitely Open jars should be refrigerated Refrigerator Dill Pickles 1 dozen or more pickling cucumbers or small English cucumbers 4 8 cloves garlic peeled and cut in half 2 3 tablespoons pickling spice the brand I used had dill seed mustard seed celery seed coriander ginger black peppercorns bay leaves and red pepper A few sprigs of fresh dill 1 small dried hot pepper or a fresh hot pepper cut in half and seeds removed optional 1 quart water boiled and cooled \u00be cup white vinegar \u00bc cup salt kosher salt works well but sea salt or table salt are also fine A pinch of sugar if desired I omitted Use one or two quart jars or a gallon jar depending on how your cucumbers fit into the jar The amounts of spices are for one gallon jar or two quart jars but you can modify this according to taste and the quantity of pickles you want to make Place one tablespoon of pickling spice half the dill and half the garlic in the bottom of the jar If using slender or English cucumbers you can cut them into thick chunks slices and they will be ready in less time If you use larger cucumbers you can pickle them whole and cut them into lengthwise quarters when you serve them Pack the cucumbers tightly into the jar s When you have added most of the cucumbers add half of the remaining spices and garlic When all the pickles are in the jar add the last of the spices If using the pepper place it in the middle layer When the jar is full of cucumbers and spices stir the salt into the vinegar Pour the mixture into the boiled water and stir to finish dissolving the salt The water does not have to reach room temperature since it will continue to cool as you make the brine Fill the jar to the brim with brine Close the jar tightly with its lid Invert the jar into a bowl and leave it outside the refrigerator After one day turn the jar upright Check to see how pickled the cucumbers are If you used the smaller slender cukes it is probably time to refrigerate the pickles They will be completely done in another three or four days If you used larger cucumbers leave them out for another day or two Check for doneness according to your preferences if you prefer half sour they should be edible after just one two days When the pickles are as done as you like them you can pour out half the brine leaving as many spices in the jar as possible Replace the removed liquid with a mixture of plain boiled water and vinegar For each cup of boiled cooled water add two tablespoons of white vinegar Fill the jar to the top again and refrigerate You can also remove the hot pepper if you don t want the pickles to get spicier over time Email Print folks, i&#8217;m finding it hard to contain my excitement about ndp&#8217;s

others he said The study asserts that narcissists are more likely to have romantic relationships that are short lived at risk for infidelity lack emotional warmth and to exhibit game playing dishonesty and over controlling and violent behaviors Twenge the author of Generation Me Why Today s Young Americans Are More Confident Assertive Entitled and More Miserable Than Ever Before said narcissists tend to lack empathy react aggressively to criticism and favor self promotion over helping others The researchers traced the phenomenon back to what they called the self esteem movement that emerged in the 1980s asserting that the effort to build self confidence had gone too far I am special I am special As an example Twenge cited a song commonly sung to the tune of Frere Jacques in preschool I am special I am special Look at me Current technology fuels the increase in narcissism Twenge said By its very name MySpace encourages attention seeking as does YouTube Some analysts have commended today s young people for increased commitment to volunteer work But Twenge viewed even this phenomenon skeptically noting that many high schools require community service and many youths feel pressure to list such endeavors on college applications Campbell said the narcissism upsurge seemed so pronounced that he was unsure if there were obvious remedies Permissiveness seems to be a component he said A potential antidote would be more authoritative parenting Less indulgence might be called for The new report follows a study released by UCLA last month which found that nearly three quarters of the freshmen it surveyed thought it was important to be very well off financially That compared with 62 5 percent who said the same in 1980 and 42 percent in 1966 Yet students while acknowledging some legitimacy to such findings don t necessarily accept negative generalizations about their generation Hanady Kader a University of Washington senior said she worked unpaid last summer helping resettle refugees and considers many of her peers to be civic minded But she is dismayed by the competitiveness of some students who seem prematurely focused on career status We re encouraged a lot to be individuals and go out there and do what you want and nobody should stand in your way Kader said I can see goals and ambitions getting in the way of other things like relationships Kari Dalane a University of Vermont sophomore says most of her contemporaries are politically active and not overly self centered Enough about me what do you think about me People are worried about themselves but in the sense of where are they re going to find a place in the world she said People want to look their best have a good time but it doesn t mean they re not concerned about the rest of the world Besides some of the responses on the narcissism test might not be worrisome Dalane said It would be more depressing if people answered No I m not special 2011 The Associated Press All rights reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed today\u2019s college students are more narcissistic and self-centered than their predecessors, according to a comprehensive new study by five psychologists who worry that the trend could be harmful to personal relationships and american society."",""url"":""msnbc msn id

anti-authoritarianism is deemed a mental health problem | "",""body"":""February 20 2012 LIKE THIS ARTICLE Join our mailing list Sign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email In my career as a psychologist I have talked with hundreds of people previously diagnosed by other professionals with oppositional defiant disorder attention deficit hyperactive disorder anxiety disorder and other psychiatric illnesses and I am struck by 1 how many of those diagnosed are essentially anti authoritarians and 2 how those professionals who have diagnosed them are not Anti authoritarians question whether an authority is a legitimate one before taking that authority seriously Evaluating the legitimacy of authorities includes assessing whether or not authorities actually know what they are talking about are honest and care about those people who are respecting their authority And when anti authoritarians assess an authority to be illegitimate they challenge and resist that authority sometimes aggressively and sometimes passive aggressively sometimes wisely and sometimes not Some activists lament how few anti authoritarians there appear to be in the United States One reason could be that many natural anti authoritarians are now psychopathologized and medicated before they achieve political consciousness of society s most oppressive authorities Why Mental Health Professionals Diagnose Anti Authoritarians with Mental Illness Gaining acceptance into graduate school or medical school and achieving a PhD or MD and becoming a psychologist or psychiatrist means jumping through many hoops all of which require much behavioral and attentional compliance with authorities even those authorities one lacks respect for The selection and socialization of mental health professionals tends to breed out many anti authoritarians Degrees and credentials are primarily badges of compliance Those with extended schooling have lived for many years in a world where one routinely conforms to the demands of authorities Thus for many MDs and PhDs people different from them who reject this attentional and behavioral compliance appear to be from another world a diagnosable one I have found that most psychologists psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are not only extraordinarily compliant with authorities but also unaware of the magnitude of their obedience And it also has become clear to me that the anti authoritarianism of their patients creates enormous anxiety for these professionals and their anxiety fuels diagnoses and treatments In graduate school I discovered that all it took to be labeled as having issues with authority was not kissing up to a director of clinical training whose personality was a combination of Donald Trump Newt Gingrich and Howard Cosell When I was told by some faculty that I had issues with authority I had mixed feelings about being so labeled On the one hand I found it amusing because among the working class kids I had grown up with I was considered relatively compliant with authorities After all I had done my homework studied and received good grades However while my new issues with authority label made me grin because I was now being seen as a bad boy I was also concerned about just what kind of profession I had entered Specifically if somebody such as myself was labeled as having issues with authority what were they calling the kids I grew up with who paid attention to many things that they cared about but didn t care enough about school to comply there Well the answer soon became clear Mental Illness Diagnoses for Anti Authoritarians A 2009 Psychiatric Times article titled ADHD ODD Confronting the Challenges of Disruptive Behavior reports that disruptive disorders which include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and opposition defiant disorder ODD are the most common mental health problem of children and teenagers ADHD is defined by poor attention and distractibility poor self control and impulsivity and hyperactivity ODD is defined as a a pattern of negativistic hostile and defiant behavior without the more serious violations of the basic rights of others that are seen in conduct

responses For many of us pain is a regular fact of life which is known to bring with it various problems of restlessness decreased immunity depression and anxiety Most of us deal with pain by consuming over the counter painkillers such as aspirin paracetamol or ibuprofen Because pain is an everyday problem in the present world it is not astonishing that natural painkillers have become a part of folk medicine throughout the world Natural pain killers are the drug free remedies that are just as effective as drugs in relieving pain without producing any side effects More recently some high tech food supplements have also been developed to prevent pain The top ten natural pain killers are as follows Fish oil Fish oil contains two essential omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA These fatty acids are known to block the production of inflammatory chemicals called cytokines and leukotrienes in the body which are responsible for a range of painful conditions including rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s disease gout and sinusitis Researchers found that eating 3 g of fish fats a day relieved the joint pain inflammation and morning stiffness associated with rheumatoid arthritis RA and reduced the drug requirement In another study of rheumatoid arthritis patients daily supplementation with 2 7 grams of EPA and 1 8 grams of DHA resulted in striking reduction in the number of tender joints and increase in the time span before fatigue appeared Various other studies have put forth that the same dosage of fish oil can reduce the severity of Crohn s disease by more than 50 per cent and make it possible for many patients to stop anti inflammatory medication and steroids Olive oil Olive oil has been found to contain a natural chemical which acts like the anti inflammatory pain killer ibuprofen The active ingredient in olive oil is oleocanthal which influences the same biochemical pathway as ibuprofen and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs The researchers concluded that 50 gram of extra virgin olive oil was comparable to about 10 per cent of the ibuprofen dose recommended for adult pain relief Although headache will not be cured with this yet regular olive oil consumption is expected to provide some of the long lasting benefits of ibuprofen Tart cherries According to researchers at Michigan State University the eating about 20 tart cherries may relieve pain better than aspirin and may also exhibit antioxidant properties comparable to supplements like vitamin E That number of cherries are said to contain 12 25 milligrams of the active ingredients called anthocyanins Anthocyanins inhibited cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 enzymes which were the targets of anti inflammatory drugs at doses more than ten times lower than aspirin Thus daily consumption of cherries has shown the potential to reduce pain related to inflammation arthritis and gout Saliva Saliva has been found to generate a natural painkiller of up to six times more strength than morphine The substance produced by human saliva is similar to opiorphin and has been said to generate a new class of natural painkillers that are far better than the traditional drug morphine which has many addictive and psychosomatic side effects The researchers demonstrated that the opiorphin acts in nerve cells of the spine and stops the usual destruction of the natural pain killing opiates known as the enkephalins White willow barkWhite willow bark decreases pain by blocking the production of inflammatory prostaglandins White willow bark is also a very effective fever reducer It is said to contain a compound called salicylic acid and aspirin acetyl salicylic acid is a synthetic form of this compound White willow bark provides all pain relieving benefits of aspirin Conventionally is safer then aspirin and other synthetically derived salicylate based anti inflammatory drugs No contra indications and serious side effects have ever been reported by medical science It is said to provide relief to headache toothache backache or even arthritis It is important to keep in mind that white willow bark should not be taken with aspirin or by people who sensitive to salicylates Though it is far less irritating to the stomach yet it should be avoided by people with gastritis or ulcers or could be used in suppository form only It should not be used by children under 16 because of the associated possibility of developing Reye s syndrome in children during a viral infection MSM MSM methyl sulphonyl methane is a naturally occurring sulphur compound It is a powerful painkiller with anti inflammatory anti spasmodic and analgesic properties and it inhibits the transmission of pain impulses In a double blind study conducted at the UCLA School of Medicine in America researchers showed that 80 per cent pain control was achieved within six weeks in degenerative arthritis patients receiving MSM but only a negligible improvement was observed in the control group It is available both as a dietary supplement and as a cream for topical application Glucosamine and chondroitinGlucosamine and chondroitin are nutritional supplements that significantly reduce the pain of arthritic joints In Europe oral glucosamine is a commonly used pain killer and is even approved as a prescription drug They may also be effective in topical use The results of a study put forth that a cream containing glucosamine chondroitin and camphor decreased arthritic knee pain more than a placebo cream Boswellia Clinical trials have proved that the Indian herb boswellia is as effective as conventional drugs for both chronic and minor pains Boswellic acids the active ingredients in boswellia are more potent and less toxic than standard NSAIDs Boswellic acids decrease the production of inflammatory compounds the leukotrienes that are implicated in many chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis Boswellia is available both as a supplement and as a topical cream A comparative study conducted on 175 rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated that 97 per cent of these patients had moderate to excellent recovery from pain swelling and morning stiffness after consuming 450 to 750 mg of boswellic acids daily for three to four weeks These results were comparable to those for patients taking ketoprofen and phenylbutazone but unlike the drug treatments boswellic acids produced no adverse effects Devil s claw Devil s claw native to South Africa is another herb that is best known for alleviating back pain and arthritis The active ingredients in this herb are called iridoid glycosides that are responsible for producing its analgesic and anti inflammatory effects A French trial found it as effective as and safer than the anti arthritis drug diacerhein One four month study included around 120 people with knee and hip osteoarthritis and put forth that devil s claw decreased pain and increased function as good as a regular osteoarthritis medicine but with a lot fewer side effects People with gastric ulcers should consume devil s claw with caution since it increases the gastric acid production Curcumin Turmeric contains the compound curcumin which is a powerful painkiller known to block inflammatory proteins and enhance the body s ability to suppress inflammation Turmeric is used in place of NSAIDs without any side effects to the organs including stomach heart liver and kidneys Various studies put forth that curcumin eases the chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis The pain relievers found in curcumin stop the neurotransmitter substance P from sending its pain signals to the brain Curcumin also decreases inflammation by reducing prostaglandin activity 400 to 600 mg of curcumin should be consumed three times daily In order to improve absorption it can be consumed with equal amounts of bromelain an anti inflammatory enzyme found in pineapples 20 minutes before meals Plenty more Cool Stuff Leave a Reply You

jelly crystals in boiling water then add necessary amount of icing sugar Boiled Icing RecipeTake one cup of sugar to the beaten white of one egg Put the sugar on to boil with two tablespoonfuls of water When this has boiled clear pour on the beaten white of the egg stirring constantly until cold Flavor with rose water and vanilla mixed Recipe For Almond Icing Marzipan Frosting Recipe Take the whites of two eggs and half a pound of sweet almonds with a few bitter mixed which should be blanched dried and grated or pounded to a paste Beat the whites of the eggs add half a pound of confectioner s sugar a handful at a time until all is used up and then add the almonds and a few spoonfuls of rose water Spread between or on top of cake Put on thick and when nearly dry cover with a plain icing If the cakes are well dredged with a little flour after baking and then carefully wiped before the icing is put on it will not run and can be spread more smoothly Put the frosting in the center of the cake dip a knife in cold water and spread from the center toward the edge Plain White Icing RecipeBeat up the white of an egg with one quarter of a pound of pulverized sugar until thick half a pound for two whites and so on Set in a very warm place to dry Pink IcingThis icing is made as above or like boiled icing using pink confectioner s sugar or color with cochineal food coloring or prepared fruit coloring which you may procure at any first class grocery Yellow IcingGrate the peel of one or more oranges put the peel in a fine batiste fabric rag tie it up and boil in a few spoonfuls of water Squeeze it to extract the color and boil with as much sugar as you want for icing say two whites of eggs juice of one orange and two cups of sugar You may use the orange juice in place of the water Chocolate IcingMake a stiff icing by beating the whites of four eggs and adding gradually one pound of sifted powdered sugar Add gradually one third of a cake of bitter chocolate which you have previously melted in a tin cup on the back of the stove Mix with icing and flavor with vanilla This quantity is enough to ice the layers and top of a large cake Chocolate Icing Recipe Without EggsBoil chocolate with very little water and sugar until thick It must harden on the spoon when cool Flavor with vanilla and spread Set in a very warm place to harden Chocolate Icing UnboiledBeat the whites of three eggs and one and one half cups of pulverized sugar added gradually while beating Beat until very thick then add four heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla Frosting for a strawberry cake should not be set in the oven and it should not be frosted longer than half an hour before serving and then set in the ice chest immediately Try this and you will never do otherwise Tastes like whipped cream You may flavor with vanilla or strawberry juice Lemon Peel Flavoring For Use With Cake Icing RecipesKeep a wide mouthed bottle of brandy in which to throw lemon peel Often you will have use for the juice of lemons only Then it will be economical to put the lemon peel in the bottle to use for flavoring A teaspoonful of this is sufficient for the largest cake Unboiled IcingTake the white of one egg and add to it approximately the same quantity of water Stir into this as much confectioner s sugar to make it of the right consistency to spread upon the cake Flavor with any flavoring desired You may color it pink as you would boiled frosting by adding fruit coloring Chocolate Icing RecipePrepare the above unboiled icing add as much grated chocolate as you desire and flavor with vanilla Yellow or Golden IcingIs made just as you would the white unboiled icing substituting the yolk of the egg instead of the white flavor with orange juice and if you wish a deeper yellow grate the orange peel into the juice of the orange and strain through a fine piece of cheesecloth before adding to the yellow icing Coconut IcingMix coconut with the unboiled icing If you desire to spread it between the cakes scatter more coconut over and between the layers Nut IcingMix any quantity of finely chopped nuts into any quantity of cream icing unboiled as in the foregoing receipts Ice the top of cake with plain icing and lay the halves of walnuts on top Maple Sugar IcingBoil two cupfuls of maple sugar with half a cupful of boiling water until it threads from the spoon Pour it upon the beaten whites of two eggs and beat until cold Spread between and on top of cake A pretty effect is made by sprinkling desiccated coconut

and I had been engaged for about 2 years you would think we would be able to spread out the wedding planning But after booking the ceremony and reception venue early we kinda left everything else till 1 month prior to the set date Um Being super laid back doesn t quite work when you are planning a wedding for more than 175 people Our photos were taken by the awesome Trish and Joel from Tealilyphotography and all photos in my next few posts will be from them unless otherwise credited Noods and I had based the date of our wedding around when Trish would be free because we knew we just had to have them for our photographers Have a look at her portfolio she is super talented and she loves what she does which always shines through in her photos We also chose February over September because I didn t want to be cold and knew we would both be busy with work at that time of year I deliberately chose to have our wedding in the afternoon because I knew I didn t want to wake up at the crack of dawn to do hair and makeup haha I value my sleep Hair and makeup was done at Lattouf Hair Spa Shop 4034 Level 4 Westfield Parramatta for myself and my 2 bridesmaids 460 The staff are super lovely and actually listened to what I wanted and tried different hairstyles until I was happy I had done a hair and makeup trial at another place which I refuse to name as it was cheap but quickly realised cheap nasty haha so yeah Lattouf was recommended by a friend and their gallery of photos was reassuring We were greeted with a bottle of champagne which was a nice touch and got the morning kick started with a bang You can t see me but I m sneakily drinking my champers while the lady takes our pic hehe also meet my bridesmaids lols you will see Shez later on but Helen my maid of honour will be blurry cos she wants to remain anonymousIn need of lunch that wouldn t kill our makeup we opted for nuggets Funnily enough Noods and his groomsmen ate nuggets for their lunch too And a box of cookies After deciding that we would go all out with a candy theme for our wedding i decided to not have any fresh flowers and instead ordered different sized lollipops for the bouquets for the girls boutonnieres for the guys pins from Riot 8 superglue 2 extra ones for table decorations at wedding and some super ginormous ones to put in pots for decoration down the aisle Certain candy stores were charging such exorbitant prices on lollipops that I ordered the lollipops straight from manufacturer Walker s Candy in Perth as the bulk prices and shipping would cost me less than buying from the store i posted about them here where I bought 178 lollipops 618 20 incl shipping and they actually found the post and sent me over another box of lollipops for free woohoo sweeeet D I was worried lollipops might melt so i bought some spray lacquer krylon spray crystal clear glaze 32 95 from Eckersley s While waiting for the lacquer to dry why not check TwitterHello mother After getting her hair and makeup done my mum arrives first at my house to help me with my dress I bought my dress from Brides In Love 30 Toohey Rd Wetherill Park off the rack for 600 Alterations were another 175 and i got a free veil and handbag thrown in the deal After visiting every single bridal dress store in Wetherill Park I was feeling discouraged because dresses were so expensive and i couldn t find one that I super liked Jana took one look at me and straight away picked this dress and I was over the moon with happiness haha while it helps to have some idea of what kind of dress you want sometimes the dress you think would look good on you doesn t actually suit you so it helps to get an opinion and to try dresses in other styles and colour And yes there is a difference between pearl cream and ivory haha Attempting to wedge veil into my hair Our colour scheme was rainbow so the bridesmaids dresses are purple and green Myer 180 reduced to 95 and groomsmen had red and blue tiesTying ribbon Reject

Sabo 105 for gummy bear pendant chain and pendant holder earrings are white gold hoops from my new mother in law Mrs Wong and lols notice the Snoopy on my dad s watch Hoho my sneakers i bought a pair of white sneakers from Kmart 15 and the awesome Mikey customised them for me i didn t want to chance falling over in heels and sneakers have always stuck in my mind since the first time I ever watched Father of the Bride heh heh Couldn t decide if I should change the laces to white but decided i wanted some colour Pink is awesome Meanwhile the boys are at Pullman s Hotel Olympic Boulevard Sydney Olympic Park Homebush Bay getting ready we scored the suite as a bonus gift from our dinner reception The boys had hired suits from Spurling Parramatta 1 85 93 Victoria Rd Parramatta 648 for the 3 of them i had gone with them when they tried on the suits and oh boy was it painful It s like minding a 10 year old who can t stop fidgeting and walking around Adjusting the lollipop boutonniere Oh dear Such posers heheMmm nommyGroomsmen guarding groom guarding lollipop The boys had arrived early at Eryldene Historic House and Garden 17 McIntosh St Gordon to set up the chairs and organise the decorations Photo from Connie Lollipop garden all set Giant lollipops were placed in a pipe which my dad had cemented into a pot and placed in a shiny box to line the aisleBlue steel Haha i can see Noods standing unhappily in Josh s sunnies lol it was really really hot that day But we weren t about to complain because if it had rained we would have had to hire a marquee which would be We had waited all year for the week s forecast and luckily it was perfect weather Uh a little hot But perfect Hai Will Like the groomsmen s 8 bit ties i bought them from Think Geek US 14 99 We arrive and hide behind a hedge to spy on the guests before the ceremony starts Click here for the whole post 5 April 2010 02 01 So after setting up the chairs and greeting the guests the boys took a second to channel their inner bsb The slow chords of Pachelbel s Canon In D begins and the bridesmaids enter the garden Photo from Jodie Woohoo my turn Photo from Karen Girls practice walking around in your

then Photo from Jen WHEEEEEE and then our Canon D song rips into a rock riff and it s time to rock on down the aisle Thanks Billy Photos from Melissa that i turned into a dodgy gif Heh heh i d only told my dad that we d be dancing down the aisle about 2mins before the ceremony started 3 steps to the right pause 3 steps to the left pause and repeat Made it to our altar in one piece without any wardrobe malfunctions lol our awesome celebrant was Renee who knew Noods from working with him previously and did an awesome speech incorporating all our quirks from guitar hero jokes to a whole bunch

never quite understood why people liked baked mac and cheese In my experience it was almost always an dried out flavorless dish at potlucks that is NOT mac and cheese Eventually I learned my favorite way to make mac and cheese was the way my nanny always made it while I was growing up She would just cook the noodles throw in some butter milk and American cheese slices season with salt and pepper and voila It was and is to this day fabulous But in the cooking world I have noticed that most people really love baked mac and cheese so I decided to try five different recipes from trusted sources and see if I could find one that even I would enjoy I diligently baked through all five recipes and while all were good and some were definitely better than others there was no clear stand out winner None of them were that perfect mac and cheese I was hoping for I decided that maybe I just did not like baked mac and cheese period I was pondering whether to even post my results or just scrap the whole idea when one more mac and cheese recipe popped up in my Google Reader from Pioneer Woman Of course I knew I had to try it since none of her other recipes have failed me yet but I was particularly intrigued by her recipe because she claims you can eat it simply mixed with the cheese sauce or baked I m sure you can see where all this is leading Pioneer Woman s version did turn out to be my clear winner I made half a batch unbaked and baked the rest in ramekins Though I was very excited at the prospect of the non baked version I would not recommend it It was okay but not great The flavor of the dry mustard was too strong and it just had a strange texture I wasn t expecting to like the baked version better but it blew me away The texture was perfectly creamy possibly due to the egg in the sauce and the cheese flavor was perfect The recipe makes a huge quantity but I ended up baking all of it and we ate every last bit over the course of a week I only got pictures of her unbaked version sorry Now let me say in hindsight I wish I had used some sort of objective scoring scale to differentiate between all of these recipes texture cheesiness flavor etc but I did not I will just quickly summarize my thoughts on the others here and then get to the good one The runner up smoked mac and cheese from Williams Sonoma Alton Brown this probably ended up being my least favorite of the recipes It just didn t have a very cheesy flavor It did taste slightly better as leftovers and I liked the Panko breadcrumbs on top but I just wasn t crazy about this version Picky Palate I was really expecting to like this recipe because it uses some wonderful cheeses gruyere mascarpone etc but I thought while it was incredibly creamy the cheese flavor again was just not strong enough Ben loved this one Ina Garten This was probably my second favorite of the runners up The cheddar and gruyere gave it a nice flavor and I liked the use of cavatappi noodles I did skip the tomato slices on top because I just wanted a classic version Southern Living via Elizabeth s Edible Experience This is the only recipe of them all that does not involve making a roux as the base of the cheese sauce This is made even quicker and easier by simply adding the milk flour and seasoning to a container shaking vigorously and then mixing it with the cheese and noodles I was actually surprised at how well this turned out considering how easy it is It was good just not the best Williams Sonoma this was my favorite of the runners up I think the smoked gouda imparted a great flavor and the buttery French bread crumbs on top were a great touch This was excellent as leftovers and I would make it again Pioneer Woman s Baked Mac and CheeseIngredients 4 cups uncooked macaroni4 tbsp butter1 4 cup all purpose flour2 1 2 cups whole milk2 tsp dry mustard1 egg beaten1 lb cheese grated I used all cheddar but I m sure a combination would be great too 1 2 tsp salt1 4 tsp garlic powder1

until slightly firm Drain and set aside In a large pot melt the butter over medium low heat Whisk in the flour and cook the mixture for five minutes whisking constantly and being careful not to burn Add the milk to the pot stir in the dry mustard and whisk until smooth Cook the mixture for five minutes until very thick Reduce the heat to low Add the beaten egg to a small bowl Take 1 4 cup of the

Sports funniest sports photobombs"",""body"":""Photobombing is the act of somehow disrupting or creepily placing yourself in the middle of someone else s photograph Basically photobombing is doing anything to draw attention to yourself when you are not the star of the photo It s a prank as old as photography itself That s right Photobombing dates back to the days when men wore those old timey bathing suits ladies wore bloomers and governments were proving pesticides were safe by spraying them over little kids Heck someone even found a Civil War era photobomb in 2011 But back in the olden days only a very few number of people could actually enjoy a photobomb because photos were kept private rather than plastered all over the interwebs for the entire world to enjoy Things may not be perfect today but the Internet sure has created a lot of entertaining content for everyone to share And the government is no longer spraying DDT all over us that we know of Hilarious photobombing is just one of the many privileges of the modern world in which we live Let s take a look at some of the funniest photobombs in sports Honorable Mention Celtics Fan Photobombed at Martin Luther King Jr Monument I realize this Celtics fan isn t an athlete or any way involved with sports but the fact that he s wearing a jersey is good enough for me Plus this was too funny not to include I have no idea what precipitated this scene or why the Celtics fan is posing like such a goofball but I wish I had been on hand to witness it 25 Josh Hamilton Photobombs Josh Hamilton Fans Getting photobombed by a couple of weirdos sitting behind you at a baseball game is one thing Sure it s amusing but it isn t exactly something you ll remember forever Getting photobombed by Josh Hamilton the star player of your very favorite baseball team who you came to see play that s something special 24 London Olympics Photobomb Guy As much as NBC tried to ruin the 2012 Olympics in London for all of America there were still plenty of bright spots that the evil peacock overlords were unable to snuff out I don t know what sport this is who the guy with the necklace is or what countries are competing But what I do know is that this photobomb guy is awesome 23 Hottie Braves Fans Are Not Alone Just when you think you re alone These beautiful Braves fans were pausing for a picture when someone else found his way right into the middle of the frame I d actually assume that guy is a total creeper based on his face but the fact that he s wearing a Bill Murray shirt changes my perception entirely Thanks to The Chive for the photo Chive on 22 Ben Olsen Full Time D C United Coach Part Time Photobomber In July 2012 Ben Olsen the coach of the D C United soccer team participated in a charity tennis match at Kastles Stadium in D C He must not be too bad at tennis because his team won Hence the celebratory photobombing of his own teammates 21 Couple Being Creeped On Big Time Look at this cute couple behaving like regular human beings in love taking in what looks to be a baseball or hockey game Awwwwww Well almost Unbeknownst to them a very bald very wide eyed very crazy looking man was hellbent on getting in on that action Photobomb com is loaded with hilarious gems like this 20 Tiger Woods Green Man Photobomb I m not sure what is up what s with the spandex unitard Green Man that has become a global sports phenomenon but it s been going on for years and shows no sign of stopping These guys have been popping up at sporting events all over the world and have dropped in on Tiger Woods more than a few times 19 Phil Jackson Fails to Impress One Fan Former Lakers and Bulls coach and living legend Phil Jackson is arguably the best coach in sports history and he s got an epic 11 NBA championships under his belt I m certainly impressed by his achievements but some people are harder to please Like the lady snoozing behind him in a seat that has to be expensive as hell 18 Ryan Kesler Photobombs Everyone in the World Okay maybe not everyone in the world but the Canucks Ryan Kesler has photobombed what seems to be everyone on his own team Sometimes it s a friendly smile or a blank stare And other times he s eating pizza Check out this video compilation on YouTube for the full monty 17 Blonde Fans Photobombed by a Werewolf If you re taking a photos of yourself and or a friend at a sporting event or anywhere with stadium seating really odds are you re going to end up with a photobomb at one point or another But it s a rare occasion to get one so freaky I wish I knew what event these girls are actually at because I d like to avoid it in the future The beer clutching werewolf in the green shirt and his 18 months pregnant girlfriend are not the type of people I d want to be sitting next to Ever 16 Photobomber Shares RG3 s ESPY Award Moment Sometimes people just find themselves in the right place at the right time That almost never happens to me but it probably happens to the guy who is photobombing Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III all the time I m jumping ahead a bit considering RG3 only has three NFL games under his belt to date but what if he wins a Super Bowl MVP or ends up in the NFL Hall of Fame That guy is going to have quite the center piece photo for his man cave 15 Roy Oswalt Is Feeling the Funny Instead of the Pressure Leading up to the 2010 MLB Playoffs all the big boys were feeling the post season pressure mounting Of course some people deal with pressure better than others Then Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt obviously takes stress in stride as evidenced by this ridiculous photobomb 14 Not Even Spiderman Isn t Above Photobombing Who knew Spiderman was a football fan With all that he s got on his plate you wouldn t think he d have much leisure time on his hands But it seems that on occasion he takes a break from pining for Mary Jane and single handedly saving the world to catch a live NFL game I m not sure if he roots for the Bills or the Eagles but considering he s kind of a masochist who gets kicked around a lot in his real life I d put my money on Peter Parker being a Bills fan 13 Chris Bosh Pop in Photobombs LeBron James The Heat s Chris Bosh has a history of photobombing his teammates and this pop in to the frame during an interview with LeBron James is definitely one of the best Check out the video on YouTube to see the full moment in all its glory 12 Aaron Rodgers King of NFL Photobombs Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was obviously a natural born photobomber because he has been making ridiculous appearances behind his Green Bay teammates since he was playing backup to Mr Brett Favre Rodgers photobombs are hilarious and done often enough that they require their very own website Check out Rodgers Photobombs for the complete gallery of absurdity 11 Monkey See Monkey Do Clay Matthews Learns from His Quarterback Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has been photobombing his teammates for years but in August 2012 his linebacker with the luscious blonde locks proved A Rodge isn t the only game in town Clay Matthews stepped into the frame during Rodgers post game interview with a hot blonde and stole the show with his stone cold stare 10 Oh Jets Mets Fans I m always impressed when I meet a lifelong Jets fan or a Mets fan Mostly because if you re a New York sports man your life must be infinitely less stressful and filled with happiness and championships if you just jumped on board with the Giants and Yankees But kudos to this pair for standing strong and paying money on any given night to see the Mets lose to any given team They re so excited just to be on TV that they re calling up their friends and family to let them know Nobody tell them those cell phones are bananas though they ve suffered enough 9 Weirdo Manages to Upstage Cowboys Cheerleader Melissa Kellerman It probably goes without saying that it s pretty difficult to upstage a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader under most circumstances Somehow it s happened to the mellifluous Melissa Kellerman twice now In 2011 she was upstaged by Cowboys tight end Jason Witten when he ran her over during the course of a game And in 2012 this creepshow found himself starring in one of her Twitter photos 8 Ray Whitney Upstaging a Teammate Via Photobomb The 2011 12 NHL season was one of the best of Phoenix Coyote Ray Whitney s 20 year career in the league Apparently he celebrated all year long by photobombing his teammates at every opportunity FOX Sports Arizona s Graham Taylor diligently documented Whitney s shenanigans throughout the season See the full slideshow here 7 Ray Whitney Upstaging a Teammate Again They were just too good not to include another Kudos to Ray Whitney one of the best photobombers ever 6 Phillies Fan with a NSFW Shirt Photobomb Actually I m not even sure if that s a NSFW word but it sure is a great way to attract attention It made me laugh but I probably wouldn t pick one up myself 5 Peter DeBoer Unmoved by a Large Pair of Photobombs To be honest I m not even sure if this counts as a photobomb but I suspect not too many of you out there are going to be outraged over its inclusion Obviously down 3 0 to the Kings in the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals Devils coach Peter DeBoer probably had an awful lot on his mind at the time That doesn t mean it s not impressive that he managed to ignore the scene behind him If a nuclear bomb was dropping on Los Angeles at the time it would be hard for most men to avert their gaze from this spectacle 4 Alex Smith and the World s Most Casual Photobomber You might not be all that impressed with this photobomb just by looking at the photo All this guy in the hoodie is doing is standing casually behind 49ers quarterback Alex Smith while simultaneously managing to line his dome up perfectly with the NBC Peacock logo But it s actually much much more if you check out the full video over at FunnyOrDie Usually photobombers on TV immediately lose their marbles and are quickly wrangled by security for causing a commotion Hoodie guy learned from their mistakes He casually walks into the frame as if he s supposed to be there and proceeds to stand around looking both hilariously awkward and completely content with life for a full two minutes This guy should have his own Budweiser Real Men of Genius commercial 3 There Are Pervs Lurking Everywhere I have no idea what possesses a person to do something like this in public but I am glad that there are people who think differently than me when it comes this type of photobomb Just so long as he keeps his own personal golf club in his pants then it s just some good clean isn fun 2 Tiger Woods Super Excited Photobombing Guy If you want to attract attention to yourself there may be no better athlete out there to photobomb than the legendary Tiger Woods Generally you d you d just be a nameless goofball that pops up on the interwebs but not this guy YAHOO Sports actually tracked him down and interviewed him His name is Ben Turner he s from North Carolina and he s obviously awesome You can read Jay Busbee s full interview over on YAHOO and or follow Turner on Twitter benturnerlive 1 Chris Bosh Creeps Up on Dwyane Wade Chris Bosh might not get as much attention as the Heat s LeBron James and Dwyane Wade but he definitely knows how to steal the show when he wants to Sometimes it s on the court during the game And sometimes it s on the court after the game Here he is creeping up on Dwyane Wade after the Heat put a beating on the Knicks during the 2012 NBA Playoffs Check out the video on the YouTubes if you want to see how the whole event went down Photobombing Hall of Fame Mustache Man The Cigar Guy may be the most famous photobomber of all time He was spotted in a photo behind a Tiger Woods chip shot at the 2010 Ryder Cup and went on to become a global sensation The fan s name is Rupesh Shingadia and he is impossible to miss donning a wig a ridiculous fake mustache and chomping on a cigar Apparently his get up was a tribute to Spanish golfer Miguel Angel Jimenez but its ridiculousness went on to spark an Internet meme Photobombing Hall of Fame Photobomb Face Guy Most of us had never heard of Jack Blankenship before he showed up at a Knicks game brandishing a gigantic photo of his own face in February 2012 His quest for fame was aided by the global phenomenon known as Linsanity which was just taking off at the time The Self Face Photobomb Guy is a University of Alabama super fan who had been doing his thing in Tuscaloosa for awhile before taking it national Blankenship went on to make an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and was flown to Los Angeles by FunnyOrDie to do his schtick at a Clippers game Forget this kid though He s day

say I m easily distracted by food science And chocolate well it s terribly interesting stuff You ll thank me for all those posts later I promise you Well maybe not So anyway Opera cake If at all possible I suggest that you make up all your various components on one day then build the cake the next Because let s face it it s easy to get worn out over the course of a lengthy baking or cooking project Enthusiasm wanes with time and impatience sets in and that opens the door to potentially catastrophic mistakes Separating the stirring and baking phase from the building phase not only gives you a breather it makes the assembly a whole lot more pleasurable All the components including the joconde will keep just fine at room temperature overnight Begin by trimming the edges off your two joconde sheets Once that s done measure them and cut them in half The exact dimensions are less important than making sure they re all the same size You want four layers which is traditional for an Opera cake You want the up side of the joconde layers when they were finished baking to remain their up side as they re more porous and will more easily absorb the syrup Job one is to apply a thin scraping of melted chocolate to the underside of the bottom layer Remove it to a separate sheet of parchment flip it over and spread the good stuff on Let it firm for a few minutes then place it in the refrigerator for a few more What will this do Besides adding still more deliciousness it will ensure that the cake doesn t stick to the cake board when it s time to slice and serve This is an excellent consequence free opportunity to practice your tempering should you be so inclined Flip it over onto your cake plate or cake board chocolate side down here again I m going traditional and using a decorated board Gently peel the parchment back center it on the board and you re ready to go First thing apply coffee syrup to your layer and don t be shy about it I know what I ve said about cake syrup in the past it s overused However in this context you really want to go hog wild Thoroughly soaking the layer will give the cake the melt in the mouth texture that Opera cakes in Paris are known for Pastry chef Camille who works in a Paris p\u00e2tisserie and makes these cakes regularly tells me the layers should be soaked until they re brown all the way through So no genteel paintings of syrup Go Jackson Pollock on the sucker And now for your first layer of buttercream Take your time and pay special attention to the edges As with all icing and or topping jobs the tendency will be to pile all the good stuff up in the middle Spread the buttercream slowly and deliberately eyeballing it from all sides to get it as even as you can You want it about a quarter inch thick Apply your next layer of cake Soak it Now it s time for your middle layer of ganache Oh yeah Spread it thinner than the buttercream Just a covering will do Apply the next layer of joconde Do I need to tell you what to do Another quarter inch layer of coffee buttercream Again check for evenness all the way around as you apply it Then the top layer of cake Edges getting a little sloppy Don t worry you ll trim those off later Check again for evenness If you have any obviously high spots it s OK to press them down a little with your palm at this point Soak soak soak And now for the top Here you want just a thin scraping of buttercream mostly to fill in any pits so the tempered chocolate top will lay on smoothy Now s a good time for a beer break if you were wondering Prepare your tempered chocolate according to the tutorial Or if you just want to melt some bittersweet chocolate and put it on that s fine too if you ve gotten this far you ve already done one heck of a job Spread it on promptly and thinly Let the chocolate firm at room temperature for about ten minutes Then using a knife you ve heated under hot tap water then dried slice off the edges to reveal the layers Keep and hide those trimmings kids The pastry chef deserves a secret greedy coffee break sometime in the next day or two Looks pretty good Maybe not an Opera cake for the ages but pretty darn decent Once that s done it s time to score the top so it doesn t shatter later when you want to cut it Again heat a long knife under hot tap water dry it and do your business Pieces can be any size you like Here I m dividing the cake into eight As rich as this cake is these pieces are huge Ten would have been better but oh well Now s the time to put your Opera cake in the refrigerator while you nip on down to the corner store for a little edible 23 karat gold What Edible gold You get it at the Quick Mart Second shelf on the right next to the oatmeal What sort of neighborhood do you live in I ll admit it s tricky stuff to handle You don t want to touch it with your fingers since it ll stick and disintegrate when you try to peel it off I use two x acto knives as implements to cut and steady it then just transfer pieces of whatever shape over to the cake Not very elegant but gold makes a statement whatever shape it s in Your Opera cake can now be refrigerated for a day or two if need be Opera cake is best slightly chilled Ideally not refrigerator cold maybe an hour or so out of the fridge When you re ready to serve separate the pieces again with a warm knife and transfer to plates Ah yes the chocolate on the bottom trick worked splendidly did it not Thanks to Camille Malmquist for all the great advice and to a very generous benefactor for the precious metal and a terrific suggestion "",""url"":""joepastry

have as much Vitamin C as a medium sized orange Rose HipHarvesting Pick only the ripe berries that are vivid red and slightly soft They have a much better flavor if picked after the first frost preferably late August September or October You can harvest them from your garden but they re more plentiful from old time shrub varieties such as rugosas and wild rose bushes What Are They They are the fruit of the rose plant and are filled with tiny seeds and covered with silky hairs The food value is found in their skin and their taste is similar to that of an apple To encourage your roses to develop them don t trim the blossoms and leave them to naturally fade and fall Uses They can be used fresh in making jelly jam pickles juice etc or they can be dried or canned to be used in the winter or served raw shredded or halved in salads sandwich fillings and desserts When dried they are also a favorite in teas and homemade potpourri Important Before using as a food source make sure the plant you re harvesting from has not been treated with pesticides or chemicals How To Dry ThemDriedCollect quantities to be dried or made into teas jellies juice pickles etc for winter use The process is very easy and similar to air drying flowers follow these directions Sort out the imperfect ones and rinse the batch Carefully pat dry Line a cookie sheet with a screen or a sheet of cardboard or parchment or wax paper and spread them across in a single layer Leave in a dark well ventilated area for a few weeks they ll be ready when they are hard wrinkly and darker in color You can also do this in the oven on the lowest setting or use a dehydrator You can dry them whole or you can cut and seed first directions below If mainly using for teas leaving whole is fine Tips To remove the hairs from them once they ve dried grind them up a bit in the food processor then shake the batch in a sieve the hairs will fall loose After they have dried stems and ends can be removed easily by plucking them off Storage Seal in airtight containers or glass jars store away from direct light TeaThere is some loss of Vitamin C if there is a lengthy delay between picking and bottling the product although one of their important advantages as a source of Vitamin C is the unusual stability of this Vitamin as compared with other Vitamin C foods Tip Avoid using aluminum cookware and utensils when preparing them as it can deteriorate their Vitamin C content How To Make Tea When Using Fresh 1 to 2 TBS per cup of boiling water steep for 10 minutes When Using Dried 2 tsp per cup of boiling water steep for 10 to 15 minutes Tip Don t throw them out once they ve been used to make tea eat them after you re done drinking the tea or add to soups or serve as a side at the supper table They still have a lot of nutritional value even after they ve been used in teas Wild Roseberry Jam Gather the berries after the first frost Remove seeds and hull Wash Add water just barely to cover the berries Cook berries until soft If mixture is too thick add water as needed Set aside to cool Mash and put through sieve To 2 cups puree add 1 cup sugar and cook slowly until thick stirring frequently A better consistency is obtained if commercial pectin is used Pour into sterilized jars and seal The jam may be used on bread and as a filling for cakes Note If desired lemon juice may be added and used either as jam or meat sauce Roseberry Catsup 4 quarts ripe berries red and ripe 1 clove garlic2 medium sized onions1 cup water or more if necessary Boil these ingredients until they are soft Strain them Add 3 4 cup of brown sugar Tie in a bag and add 1 2 TBS whole allspice1 2 TBS mace1 2 TBS whole cloves1 2 TBS celery seed2 inch stick cinnamonBoil these ingredients quickly Add 1 cup vinegar cayenne salt if desired Boil catsup 10 minutes longer Bottle it at once Seal the bottles with wax The flavor of this catsup is excellent Roseberry Crabapple Jelly Use 1 2 crabapple juice and 1 2 rose hip puree To one cup of this mixture use 3 4 cup sugar This jelly retains its Vitamin C content for as long as nine months without loss Note The puree may be combined in jelly or jam with fruit such as cranberry grape chokecherry red currant wild plum etc Combine one part rose hip to two parts fruit or one to three if taste of rose hip is not desired A little acid such as lemon juice adds to the flavor as does honey used for part or all of sugar Most products will be softer at first but will stiffen on standing Do not place in sun to stiffen as this destroys Vitamin C How To Remove Hairs SeedsIt is desirable that the hairs and seeds be removed before consuming The fine hairs associated with the seeds are unpleasant in the mouth and have an irritating action A few different methods are used try one of the following Cut in half and shake out seeds this takes the longest time Cover with water and simmer then rub through a sieve using the puree Simmer whole Rose Hips in more than enough water to cover then merely strain Bottle the juice Add sugar if desired and process 45 mins This juice contains Vitamin C and may be added to sauces soups not cream soup puddings beverages and many other foods Did You Know Women and children were encouraged to gather them during World War II when food supplies were low the Vitamin C they provided were a much needed source of nutrition and was highly valued over the winter months Source Much of the information was found in Home Canning Guide Dominion Glass Co Limited vintage booklet Receive Updates From Tipnut Right To Your Inbox

from cervical cancer vaccine "",""body"":""When the Government introduced the Cervarix vaccination programme last year some campaigners dubbed it a promiscuity jab Campaigners and families said the new figures showed the vaccination should not have been introduced via a mass programme More than one million girls have already been given the jab which is offered to all as they enter their teens Until 2011 it will also be administered to older girls so that all female teens below the age of 18 will be covered by the programme Ministers say that ultimately the scheme will save 700 lives a year while drug safety experts insist the number of suspected reactions are outweighed by the benefits from the jab Most of the more than 2 000 suspected reactions recorded by drug safety watchdog Medicines and Health care products Regulatory Agency MHRA were mild with dozens of girls recording rashes pain in the arm and allergies But the report prepared by the MHRA earlier this month also discloses cases in which teens have suffered convulsions eye rolling muscle spasms seizures and hyperventilation soon after being given the jab The analysis by the MHRA drawn up this month found 2 107 patients had reported some kind of suspected adverse reaction to Cervarix Several reported multiple reactions with 4 602 suspected side effects recorded in total Jackie Fletcher founder of Jabs a support group for families whose children have fallen ill after immunisation said she had taken dozens of calls from parents who believed their daughters had been damaged by the cervical cancer vaccine She said We have spoken to parents whose daughters have had seizures paralysis blurred vision severe headaches and the loss of feeling in parts of their body Doctors will try to convince parents that these problems are in their child s mind or have nothing to do with the vaccines but we don t think there is sufficient evidence to show Cervarix is safe Medical safety experts insist the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks They say many of the patients who experienced an adverse reaction to the jab since April 2008 including some who took part in drug trials or bought the drug privately only suffered short term side effects from the injection process not as a result of the drug There was no evidence to suggest isolated cases of other medical conditions were actually caused by the vaccine and not just a coincidence the regulator s report said Cancer charities urged parents to continue allowing their daughters to have the jabs saying the numbers were well within what would have been expected for a large scale programme and that most of the side effects were minor Robert Music director of cervical cancer charity Jo s Trust said I can understand why parents would feel cautious but this programme could reduce 70 per cent of cervical cancers We need to keep reviewing the evidence but we would really urge parents to make sure their daughters have the vaccination Stacey Jones is one of those who believes she has suffered side effects from the vaccine She was 17 when she had her first Cervarix injection Her parents Julie and Kerry from Bilston West Midlands noticed her becoming increasingly emotional in the weeks following the first two jabs but feared their happy go lucky girl had finally succumbed to adolescent moodswings Within four days of the third injection in March of this year Stacey suffered an epileptic seizure followed by 17 more in the following week She has now been diagnosed with a brain injury caused by inflammation of the brain and is being treated in an NHS rehabilitation unit in Birmingham which helps her with basic tasks like making a sandwich Seizures are minimised by five types of medication but her memory is badly damaged The family has been given no explanation for how the damage occurred Mrs Jones 44 said She was such a lovely happy go lucky girl now she is just a shell When we go to see her she can t remember what she has just eaten for tea The impact on her and all of us has been absolutely devastating I feel she has been used as a guinea pig A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline which makes Cervarix said the drug had to undergo rigorous testing with over 70 000 doses used in trials before a licence was granted He said The UK medicines safety agency has reviewed all reported adverse events relevant to Cervarix and there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine carries any long term side effects The symptoms this girl has experienced are clearly upsetting and it is understandable that the girl and her parents want to uncover the cause thousands of schoolgirls have suffered suspected adverse reactions to a \n  controversial cervical cancer vaccine introduced by the government. schoolgirls, cervical cancer,

slab of butter encased in a dough envelope This 3 layer dough butter dough package is then flattened and folded however many times it takes to get the number of layers the maker is after A folded flaky pastry for say a galette can have as few as 27 layers Croissants often have 81 Danish 243 and puff pastry can have as many as 2187 though I prefer the less flaky version of 729 What these oddly specific numbers have in common is that they re all factors of the number 3 243 is three to the fifth power which is what you get when you turn i e execute a letter fold on a three layer dough five times Pretty neat stuff that requires nowhere near the work you d think So let s begin then shall we Puff pastry which is the specific dough I m making here is one of the easier laminated doughs Its composition is easy enough to remember for every pound of butter one pound of flour and one cup of water plus one teaspoon each of salt and lemon juice It begins not unlike a pie crust by rubbing a small quantity about 5 of the butter into the flour and salt mixture Once that s done just enough of the water lemon juice mixture is added to bring the dough together As with all laminated doughs it s best to knead it as little as possible since you want to activate as little gluten as you can Notice the finished dough looks a bit dry and shaggy Park that on the counter for 20 minutes and meanwhile make the butter block It s a pretty straightforward affair requiring only the most rudimentary tools primarily this A club Actually a Chinese rolling pin but the overall effect is the same Next we need a some butter large pieces ideally left out of the fridge for about 20 minutes Below is about a pound of it sitting on a double layer of plastic wrap It s the minimum I usually work with since I figure if I m going to the trouble of rolling pastry I d like to have some left over to freeze Notice there s flour on top That helps the butter maintain its consistency longer which is important for reasons you ll soon see Add about three tablespoons per pound of butter So now all we do is cover the butter and flour with another double thick layer of plastic and apply Club A to Butter Pile B Repeat Repeat Repeat Feel good You bet it does And if your spouse and or children aren t running into the room looking terror stricken you re not hitting hard enough Keep letting out your pent up frustration until it looks rather flat Take off the plastic wrap don t worry if you ve beaten a couple of holes in it and using a knife or bench scraper cut it into a rough square and pile the trimmings back up on top Repeat the merciless beating What s it all for other than stress release Good question What you re shooting for here is a butter consistency rather like play dough Not too firm since you want it to spread as you roll the dough out But then not too soft either since if the butter actually melts it ll soak into the dough and ruin the layering effect What you re after is a plastic texture that isn t at all greasy looking or feeling If the butter starts to shine it s too warm Put it back in the fridge for half an hour and start over with the tension release hey why not The magic texture may take only one good pounding It all depends on the temperature of the butter and the room That consistency looks like this apale dull powdery looking surface Once you re there you want to lightly shove it back into the shape of a big butter pat using the side of your club like so Set it aside for a moment Now is the time to retrieve your dough and roll it out into a square slightly larger than the butter pat Don t worry if it looks scaly and nasty all will be made right in the end Put the butter pat on top like so And begin to fold it up As you re doing this you want to pull the dough up around the corners and edges to make sure it s as taught as reasonably possible Next squeeze the all the holes and seams closed use a little water if you like So now what do you think is next If you guessed more of this you d be right Because when making pastry violence is always the first resort You want to start by making cross shaped impressions in the dough then start whacking the envelope at perpendicular angles The point of all this to drive the softened butter as far as possible to the edges of the packet Smack it then rotate the package a quarter turn and do the next edge Smack turn Smack turn Smack turn And of course along the way if you see any conspicuous mounds of butter push up in the middle give them a smack for good measure no need to discriminate A minute or two of this and the dough should be starting to flatten out which means it s time to produce the rolling pin Here a big ol honkin 25 inch pin is nice but a small one will work too if that s all you ve got If you ve beaten the envelope with sufficient ferocity there should be butter within half an inch of all the edges If not it s not the end of the world Just grab the bench scraper and trim the dough until you can either see a thin layer of butter or you can feel it close to the edge Next give the dough a couple of more firm rolls with the pin until it s about a third longer than it is wide At which point you brush any residual flour off of the inside and just fold it like a letter Repeat the rolling and folding process once more and park the dough on a cookie sheet in the fridge for 15 20 minutes Having crested the difficulty hill it is now time to crack a celebratory beer because it s all smooth sailing from here whatever that curious mixture of metaphors means All you have to do is pull the dough out every so often and give a turn or two depending on the dough you re making In the early stages of a dough rolling project I find I can get away with two turns between chills But judge for yourself If the dough is feeling extremely limp you find that you re breaking layers just by handling it or butter oozes out looking shiny give it more fridge time Alternately if as you roll you notice that the butter just under the surface of the dough is rigid and breaking apart like icebergs off the Antarctic ice sheet give it a little less If I m making puff pastry which requires six turns minimum I can usually do two turns at a time early on Much past four turns though and the dough begins to get a elastic and b warm So I let the dough chill for 20 minutes before the fifth and sixth turns and half an hour for the seventh if I m doing one Once it s all done I typically roll the dough into a long strip cut it into roughly pound size pieces and freeze it in bags Boy does this stuff ever come in handy "",""url"":""joepastry 2008 how to laminate

guides and details best practices, api remains in limited preview | techcrunch"",""body"":""Earlier today Google announced that it is about to ship its first Google Glass units and just in time for them to arrive Google has now also posted the developer guidelines for its Glass Mirror API Access to the API itself it s worth noting is still in limited preview and only developers who have access to the Glass hardware will be able to work with the API Everybody else can also start working on apps based on the documentation but won t be able to test them This first version of the API which will allow developer to write what Google likes to call Glassware is still relatively limited and the most advanced feature developers get access to is probably the Glass wearer s location Because every application communicates with Glass through Google s servers the API provides developers with a set of RESTful services and is completely cloud based and none of the code will actually run on Glass itself At its core the API allows developers to send and receive information from Glass devices Using the API looks to be relatively straightforward though also a bit limited Users will subscribe to new app from the developer s website and Google has launched a set of icons developers can use on their sites for this too Google currently offers starter projects for Java and Python developers as well as client libraries for Go PHP NET Ruby and Dart Glassware The API will give developers the option to communicate with users through timeline cards which can include text rich HTML images and video These timeline cards are not unlike Google Now cards on Android and can be bundled into packages and users can navigate between them or they can come as stand alone cards The API also provides developers with the ability to add menu items to their apps These Google says can be system commands like read aloud but developers can also write custom commands for their specific apps that users can bring up through the menu system or through voice commands As for the user interface Google gives developers the option to use their own custom HTML but the Glass team also provides developers with a base CSS file As Google notes crafting your own template gives you the power to control how your content is rendered but with that power comes responsibility Because of this Google strongly encourages developers to use its own template Photos and videos H 264 and H 264 baseline should have a 16 9 aspect ratio and should have a resolution of about 640x360px chances are that s also the maximum resolution of the Glass display Audio can be delivered in the AAC and MP3 formats Best Practices Given that Glass is a new concept Google also posted some general guidelines for how apps should interact with Glass though it s not clear if the company plans to enforce any of these directly Developers Google says should make sure they apps are designed with glass in mind and should always test their apps on Glass before releasing them The glass experience should also never get in the user s way and apps shouldn t annoy users with frequent and loud notifications Apps should also focus on real time notifications and apps should react to a user s action as soon as possible Most importantly given that Glass is meant to be worn all day developers should not surprise users with unexpected functionality Overall many developers will surely feel as if Google is limiting how much they can do with Glass but it s worth remembering that this is only a first release and chances are that Google will make more features available to developers in the future Here are a few of the videos Google posted today that explain some of the Mirror API s features in more detail September 7 1998 NASDAQ GOOG Google provides search and advertising services which together aim to organize and monetize the world s information In addition to its dominant search engine it offers a plethora of

Most people choose to take this class online.\n\nPart of the chapter 7 bankruptcy process includes the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee.  The trustee's job is to make sure that your case is handled properly.  One of the trustee's tasks is to review your assets to determine whether any of your assets can be used to pay something to your creditors.  In Nevada, most people can generally keep much if not all of their property in a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  It is very important that your attorney take the time to discuss with you your assets in order to determine what the law protects (exempt assets) and what the law gives to the trustee (non-exempt assets).\n\nOnce you file a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, you will need to attend a meeting of creditors about 30 days later.  The trustee runs this meeting, and your creditors are invited to attend.  During this meeting the trustee will ask you questions about the information in your petition and make sure you have provided all of the necessary paperwork.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\n\nIn order to receive your discharge, you will also need to take a second online course, a debtor education course, after we file your bankruptcy petition for you.\n\nAfter you receive your discharge, usually about 3 to 4 months after you file your case, your debts (except for some debts like student loans and some taxes) are no longer enforceable against you.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w5MKe5GOK-g Education"",""title"":"""",""url"":""youtube watch""}"	0.340336134	0	0.0	?	?	0	1	0.134053691	0	0.117647059	0.427725531	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5MKe5GOK-g	2789	0.146551724	0.077586207	0.0	0.0

baking over the centuries has been affected by two main factors The first is our climate The influence of the Gulf Stream prevents either great heat in the summer or cold in the winter As a result hard wheats which need such heat and cold don t prosper Those wheats make flour with a high gluten content that responds well to being raised with yeast But soft wheats do grow well here The other factor has been the abundance of fuel Ireland s various medieval overlords could never exercise the tight control over forest land that landowners did in more populous less wild areas like England and mainland Europe This meant that Irish people had less trouble getting their hands on firewood Where there was no wood there was almost always heather and usually turf too As a result anyone with a hearthstone could bake at home whenever they wanted to rather than needing to use a communal bake oven to conserve fuel These two factors encouraged the Irish householder of the past two centuries to bypass yeast for everyday baking The primary leavening agent became what s now known here as bread soda just plain bicarbonate of soda to US and North American users Hence the name soda bread But for a long time most bread in Ireland was soda bread bakery bread was only available in big cities Soda bread was made either in a pot or casserole over the fire or else baked on a bakestone an iron plate usually rested directly in on the embers From these two methods are descended the two main kinds of soda bread eaten in Ireland both north and south to the present day About soda bread varieties In Ireland plain soda bread is as likely to be eaten as an accompaniment to a main meal to soak up the gravy as it s likely to appear at breakfast It comes in two main colors brown and white and two main types cake and farl People in the south of Ireland tend to make cake people in Northern Ireland seem to like farl better though both kinds appear in both North and South sometimes under wildly differing names Cake is soda bread kneaded and shaped into a flattish round then deeply cut with a cross on the top to let the bread stretch and expand as it rises in the oven This style of soda bread is normally baked in an oven These days we d normally bake it on a baking sheet cookie sheet But in earlier times before ovens were commonplace cake was routinely made in deep lidded iron casseroles hanging over the open fire or sitting right in it the casserole lids being concave to hold coals or burning turves from the fire on top so that the bread would bake evenly in radiant heat from all sides The cake style of soda bread can of course be eaten hot But it s more usual to let the loaf cool down before eating it it s a little easier to handle then It s also a lot easier to slice and that s the way it s normally seen in supermarkets and convenience stores country wide in both brown and white versions Farl is rather different When making farls the soda bread dough is rolled out into a rough circle and cut all the way through crosswise into four pieces or farls farl is a generic term for any triangular piece of baking and usually baked in a heavy frying pan or on a griddle on top of the range or stove rather than in the oven It s a flatter bread than cake and moister after the baking s finished Each farl is split in half the wide way before eating It s best when eaten hot off the griddle but it s also allowed to cool and then grilled or fried as part of other dishes especially the famous Ulster Fry One important note in the US and North America generally there s a tendency to think of soda bread as something with fruit in it This is not the case in Ireland While people have for many years sometimes added fruit to the basic dough as a treat or for a change of pace this is not usually referred to as soda bread but as tea bread fruit soda tea cake and by many other names We have recipes for these below as well But everyday soda bread in Ireland does not contain fruit Making Irish soda bread at home With all this said all you need to know about soda bread is that it s really easy and quick to make The urge to be resisted is to do more stuff to it than necessary since this is usually what keeps it from coming out right the first few times Once you ve mastered the basic mixture and technique though you can have a fresh hot loaf of soda bread or a foursome of soda farls within an hour of starting Here s the basic recipe for white soda bread All these measures are approximate The flour s volume and liquid absorptive capabilities in particular will vary depending on the local humidity 450 g 1 lb 3 1 2 cups flour either cake flour or all purpose 1 teaspoon sugar optional you can absolutely omit this if you prefer sugar free soda bread 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda Between 200 300 ml 8 10 fluid ounces buttermilk sour soured milk or plain sweet milk to mix Buttermilk is usually the preferred mixing liquid its acidity helps activate the bicarbonate of soda releasing the carbon dioxide bubbles that make the bread rise If you prefer to make soda bread without buttermilk there s no reason you can t though the recipe works better with it The flavor will be slightly different than when buttermilk is used but the difference isn t enough to outrage local Irish sensibilities so don t be overly concerned See below for more details If you want to use buttermilk but can t get it where you live there are a couple of things you can do Sour milk or soured milk isn t milk that s gone bad but a traditional Irish cultured milk that uses buttermilk as a starter Probably it evolved as a way to stretch small amounts of buttermilk a lot further The original Irish name for it is bainne clabhair clabbered milk or bonnyclabber as it s rendered in Lallans and other Scots based dialects To make it you allow regular milk to warm to room temperature stir a few tablespoons of buttermilk into it put it in a scalded container wrap this in a towel and leave it in some peaceful spot at about 75 degrees F for 24 hours The flavor isn t quite as tart as buttermilk but there s enough acid to make the bicarb react correctly If you want to use plain sweet milk instead of buttermilk go right ahead but make sure to add 1 2 teaspoon of baking powder to the recipe First things first decide which kind of soda bread to make If you re making farl find your heaviest griddle or non sloping sided frying pan cast iron is best and put it on to preheat at a low medium heat You re going to have to experiment with settings Farl should take about 20 minutes per side to get a slight toasty brown If you ve decided to make cake find a baking sheet and preheat the oven to 450 Full preheating is vital for soda bread Combining the ingredients the basic technique Sift the dry ingredients together at least once or twice to make sure the bicarbonate of soda is evenly distributed Put the sifted dry ingredients in a good big bowl you want stirring room and make a well in the center Pour about three quarters of the buttermilk or sour milk or whatever in and start stirring You are trying to achieve a dough that is raggy and very soft but the lumps and rags of it should look dryish and floury while still being extremely squishy if you poke them Add more liquid sparingly if you think you need it You may need more or less according to conditions local humidity and temperature the absorptiveness of the flour you re using etc Blend quickly but not too energetically until the whole mass of dough has become this raggy consistency Then turn the contents of the bowl out immediately onto a lightly floured board or work surface and start to knead The chief concern here is speed the chemical reaction of the bicarb with the buttermilk started as soon as they met and you want to get the bread into the oven while the reaction is still running on high Don t overknead You do not want the traditional smooth elastic ball of dough you would expect with a yeast bread You simply want one that contains almost everything that went into the bowl in one mostly cohesive lump You should not spend more than half a minute or so kneading the less time the better Fifteen seconds may well be enough because you don t want to develop the gluten in the flour at all If you do you ll get a tough loaf So don t overdo it Don t be concerned if the dough is somewhat sticky flour your hands and the dough and keep going as quickly as you can There is a whole spectrum of wetness for soda bread dough in which it s possible to produce perfectly good results farl in particular sometimes rises better if the dough is initially wet enough to be actively sticky You may have to experiment a few times to come to recognize the right texture of dough How to shape the soda bread if you re making cake For cake flatten the lump of dough to a slightly domed circle or flat hemisphere about 6 8 inches in diameter and put it on the baking sheet which should be dusted lightly with flour first Then use a very sharp knife to cut a cross right across the circle The cuts should go about halfway down through the sides of the circle of dough so that the loaf will flower properly Baking cake style soda bread Put the cake s baking sheet into the preheated oven Handle it lightly and don t jar it the CO2 bubbles in the dough are vulnerable at this point of the process Let the bread alone and don t peek at it It should bake for 45 minutes at 400 450 F One of our Irish neighbors suggests you give it the first 10 minutes at 450 then decrease to 400 Also if you have a fan oven use temperatures 10 lower or so as fan ovens have a tendency to run hot At the end of 45 minutes pick up the loaf and tap the bottom A hollow ish sound means it s done For a very crunchy crust put on a rack to cool For a softer crust as above wrap the cake in a clean dishcloth as soon as it comes out of the oven Shaping the bread if you re making farl If farl is your choice use the same very sharp knife to slice cut the circle of dough into four wedges Try not to crush or compress the dough where you cut it if the knife is sharp enough you won t Baking farl on the griddle Dust the hot griddle or frying pan with a very little flour and put the farls on in gently The cut edges should be 1 2 inch or so apart to allow for expansion Give the farls 20 minutes on a side They should be a sort of mocha toasty color before you turn them Keep an eye on the heat they scorch easily When finished take the farls off the heat and wrap them in a light dishtowel hot side down The residual steam works its way up through the soda bread and softens the crust formed by the process of baking on the griddle making it more amenable to being split and toasted later Both ways the soda bread is wonderful sliced or split and served hot with sweet butter and or the jam or jelly of your choice Soda farl is also one of the most important ingredients of the Ulster Fry the world s most dangerous breakfast nothing whatsoever to do with its area of origin it s the cholesterol that comes with frying sausage and bacon and black pudding and soda bread and and and Click here for the Ulster Fry recipe Other ways of baking soda bread Some people have begun resurrecting the art of baking soda bread in the pot on the hearth as was done in this country for many years before the average householder could afford a luxury like an oven The traditional utensil was a kind of Dutch oven which has come to be known on this side of the water as the Bastable oven an iron pot about 18 20 in diameter with a concave lid The bread treated as for cake would be put in the preheated pot the pot would be covered and put down into the coals of the fire and more coals piled on top This approach produces a soda bread which rises wonderfully and bakes with great evenness But you don t need a fireplace to get a result very much like this as the gifted baker Jim Lahey has reminded us by popularizing his no knead method for baking yeast breads His technique works perfectly well for soda bread too All you have to do is Preheat your oven to its highest possible temperature usually around 250 C or 475 500 F At the same time also preheat a cast iron casserole with a tight fitting cover Cast iron works best for this However beware of using your pots for this unless they have metal handles knobs or are guaranteed by the manufacturer to be able to handle such temperatures Allow at least half an hour of preheating time When twenty five minutes of this time has gone by prepare the basic soda bread recipe as above Mix it very well in the bowl but after that leave the dough in the bowl and do not turn it out for kneading Remove the preheated pot from the oven Scoop or dump the soda bread dough into it Put the preheated lid on the pot and put the whole business back in the oven Bake at the highest heat for 10 minutes then reduce the heat to about 375 F 275 C At the twenty minute point remove the pot lid only and continue to bake At the forty minute point remove the pot from the oven Allow to stand for a couple of minutes then tip the bread out and allow to cool on a rack It doesn t get much simpler than that Variations on the basic soda bread recipe Spotted Dog Add raisins and maybe another teaspoon of sugar Currant soda 1 1 2 lb flour 4 oz currants 4 oz raisins 2 oz mixed candied peel 3 oz butter 1 tsp bicarb 1 tsp cream of tartar 1 2 tsp salt 2 tablespoons sugar buttermilk to mix judge it by eye as above Sieve the dry ingredients together rub in the butter add the fruit Add the buttermilk roll out very lightly cut into farls and bake as for farl above Golden soda Substitute about 1 cup of fine ground cornmeal for a cup of the flour One of my sources tells me this works better as cake than as farl A really heretical variation Add chopped Jalapeno peppers to the dry ingredients Mix and bake as above EuroCuisineLady adds Mum would probably have whacked me one if she d ever caught me doing this But it does taste wonderful For Brown soda wheaten bread 4 cups whole wheat flour 1 cup white flour Scant 1 2 cup oatmeal 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda 1 teaspoon salt 2 3 cups sour milk or buttermilk Mix and bake exactly as for plain soda above If you have trouble with this one rising your local mixture of whole wheat flour may be responsible try decreasing the amount of whole wheat and increasing the white flour Treacle bread now has its own page at our site here Notes and additions For those of you hunting a

reading 2 or 3 books weekly Though some books take a lot longer than others Developing the reading habit is difficult at first because it takes work But like physical exercise for your body that s how you know it is actually benefiting your brain You don t have to crawl in agony through Ulysses seriously take my word for it you don t non fiction and history are great choices as well 2 Stay Nimble It s a great idea to do crossword puzzles games quizzes memory tests and other mind twisters Even online computer games and Sudoku puzzles are fun ways to keep your brain active and sharp Find some you like and do them frequently Here are some games or you can develop your logical reasoning I like to study the logical fallacies Yep I m a nerd Sweet 3 Get Enough Sleep Though it should go without saying if you do not get adequate sleep every night your cognitive function will be severely impaired I used to have trouble sleeping and even after dietary changes and increased exercise I still had a tough time falling asleep This made me grouchy in the mornings I finally realized I wasn t giving myself enough processing time I would work and read and write all day and then I d exercise and try to go straight to bed Bad idea Now I play a little every night and even horror of horrors turn off the computer Sometimes I slip back into my old ways but I m getting better If you ve got some good sleep tips pass them along to the rest of us 4 Drink water One of the simplest ways to stay alert and refreshed particularly in the afternoon slump is to drink pure cool water I used to enjoy running down to Starbucks for an afternoon latte until my neighbor encouraged me to drink two full glasses of water after lunch instead Not only is this much less costly it s very effective Try it I still love my morning coffee though 5 Manage stress Here s one tip Obviously if you are stressed your powers of concentration and your ability to be productive can become severely hampered Though life has its ups and downs and we can t eliminate stress entirely managing it is key to maximizing your brainpower There are many ways to do this of course I d love for you to share your tips in the comments Here s one small thing that really made a significant change for me We often say it s going to work out when we are feeling anxious or uncertain I m betting you ve probably said it many times right It s a rational sensible thing to say after all One day early this past summer I was sitting idly in traffic thinking about a recent setback I suddenly found myself thinking no it s not going to work out it is working out I started saying it to myself a lot Being a so called type A A according to my friends the tendency to over think will probably always be something I have to manage But simply making that verb change was really effective for me It keeps me in the present instead of me wasting my present concentrating on possible futures that may or may not happen This might seem obvious to you but it really works well for me 6 Cover the physical bases This means eating the right foods for starters Imagine your best friend wants to get healthy You d help them focus on eating the freshest most natural nutritious foods and you wouldn t tempt them with junk food sugars and processed snacks Okay your best friend is you 7 Fish oil You all know I m a dietary fat fanatic I eat lots of fat but I also take Mark s fish oil pills usually a double dose in fact I recently went about a week without taking any out of sheer and utter slackitude and let s just say it wasn t pretty However you don t have to take my word for it Hundreds of studies have confirmed the amazing benefits of essential fatty acids such as those available in fish oil for your cognition memory and mood I recommend going to PubMed and running a quick search if you want to start digging into the studies they re endless 8 Don t do things that will shrink your brain literally Smoking and drug abuse and alcoholism have major

weeks I ve been revamping my eating habits I m eating healthier and I m eating smaller portions Along with the changes in my diet I ve started running again Well a bit more walking than running but I m following a training program and I know that soon there will be more running than walking After I had my daughter I was heavier than I d ever been I joined Weight Watchers even attended meetings and managed to lose 45 pounds I finally liked how I look in the mirror but more importantly I felt in control of my health and my life for the first time ever While I was losing that weight I kept a bowl of candy chocolates my favorite sweet on my desk I might have one piece but more often than not I completely resisted Looking back I believe I put those chocolates there as a challenge to my willpower A small daily test As each day passed that I ignored that candy bowl I felt more strong and empowered I ve slid backwards these last five years since having my second child my son Sure initially my clothes weren t fitting well because of baby weight but after a year had passed my only excuse was that I overindulged too often and regularly Exercise was not a priority and I sacrificed that part of my life for other things work spending time with the kids cooking or blogging even I m an expert at finding excuses not to exercise I m revamping my lifestyle now and I feel great about it I m ready for change More importantly I m ready to wear smaller pants So I baked another cake remember the lemon one last week this weekend Maybe I m testing myself again just like I did with those chocolates that sat on my desk begging to be eaten I m proving to myself that I can do this that I am stronger than the call of desserts Even chocolate desserts After eating one small piece of this beauty I won t have any more The rest will be shared with family and friends And tomorrow I run Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Buttercream Frosting Yield 10 servings Rich chocolate cake slathered in creamy vanilla

beer is generally the most diverse cheapest and best drink to enjoy year round With there being so many types of beers out there it can sometimes be hard to choose If you re thinking about throwing a party or bringing a cooler to a tailgating party you can use this reference list of 5 Types of Beer to create an awesome cooler If we ve missed any of your favorite types of beers be sure to add them in the comments below 1 Ales The beauty about Ales is that of all the types of beers on our list Ales have been around for the longest People in 15th century England were sitting around enjoying Ales So what is it about Ales that make them so good Well when the Ale is brewed it doesn t convert as much sugars into alcohol What does that do to the beer Well it gives it a sweeter and fruitier taste What does an Ale go well with Pretty much everything our beer experts agree that Ales are an excellent type of beer for any occasion whether you re grilling up steaks or enjoying a tray of Nachos Editors pick Try an IPA when I was a young beer drinker I thought that IPA was a different type of beer but really IPA s are an ale IPA means Indian Pale Ale IPA s still retain the sweet fruity flavor of Ales as well as an added Hops flavor Others to try Redhook ESB Widmer Hefewiezen Pyramid Snow Cap Redhook Chinook Alaskan Summer Ale 2 Lagers Whether or not you know it you ve probably drank a type of beer Lager at some time Lagers make up most of the mass produced American Labels like Budweiser and Coors Most Lagers have a significant amount of carbonation and a crisp taste Lagers generally range from very light to very dark depending on the brewer and what type of an environment they re brewed in A good microbrew lager not a domestic lager is an excellent way to introduce yourself into the world of gourmet beers What does a Lager go well with Lagers go excellent with Spicy Foods Mexican food Indian food and pizzas Editors Pick Your local Microbrew While this may be seen as a cop out answer by far the best Lager is going to be the local microbrew in your area Living in San Francisco I ve found some excellent microbrew lagers So just be adventurous Others to try Creemore Springs Premium Lager St Nicholaus Bock Bier Yebisu Black Beer Haffenreffer Private Stock Black Bavarian 3 Porters While Porters are a very strong and delicious type of beer in recent centuries their popularity has pretty much sunk They originated in England in the 1700s and were a favorite by men who worked as porters hence their names As the centuries trudged on porters became less and less popular while ales and lagers started to proliferate in the market But then in the 1970s and the 1980s due to the rise of home micro brewing Porters started to make a come back So why should you go out and pick up a porter Well Porters are dark strong and have a bitter hops flavor infused with a hint of chocolate What does a Porter go well with Porters go well with any meat dish beef chicken lamb pork etc They also go excellently with desserts Editors Pick Hands Down it s the Sierra Nevada Porter This is an excellent porter with a strong taste a delicious malty flavor to it and it s not too heavy or strong Others to try Black Butte XX Black Earth Porter Smuttynose Robust Porter Devil Over A Barrel Bourbon Barrel Aged Coffee Imperial Oatmeal Porter Alaskan Smoked Porter 4 Stouts It s hard to imagine a top 5 Types of Beer list without putting a stout on it Stouts origin is quite muddled but it can t be argued that Stouts are essentially the beer of my homeland Ireland Stouts are a very dark full bodied type of beer they re very thick and can have a flavor very similar to coffee but they can also take on many other flavors including sweet bitter milk and even oatmeal What does a Stout go well with Stouts are generally a meal in and of themselves They are so thick and strong it s hard to imagine eating anything for a while after enjoying your first stout Though it should be noted for the brave that a stout goes excellent with a gourmet hamburger Editors Pick Every Stout Stouts much like snowflakes are going to be completely different not only from distributor to distributor but just from production day to production day Don t believe me Go to your favorite Irish Bar and order a Guinness make sure it s from the tap Then go back the next day and ask them if they ve switched out the keg from last night and order a Guinness again Notice the subtle differences from yesterday s beer and today s beer So if you ve had a Bad Experience with a stout in the past go to your local bar and try a stout again I can almost guarantee that you ll enjoy the stout today Others to try Oyster Stout Samual Smith s Double Chocolate Stout Guinness Alesmith Speedway Stout Russian Imperial 5 Pilsner Pilsners originated from a town that is now part of the Czech Republic The beer has a Golden color they are clear and sparkly Pilsners have a very strong hoppy full flavor generally more overpowering than your standard lagers Pilsners are soft and easy to drink because Pilsners don t have a thick body What does a Pilsner go with Pilsners are best enjoyed with meats excluding beef Pilsners go well with mild cheese as well Lamb burgers anyone Editors Pick While Pilsners are not my favorite type of beers my friends swear by Pilsner Urquell Bohemian Pilsner If you can t find this type of beer in your local grocery store Liquor stop try out one of the other assortments of Pilsners out there If you can t find one just grab another case of Guinness Others to try Flensburger Brauerei s Bitburger Wernesgr\u00fcner F\u00fcrstenberg Schwelmer Pils Hopefully this article has been helpful for you There s an entire world of beers out there depending on where you go or where you live you can create a list of your personal favorite beers This can also be used as a crib sheet for your next party Instead of buying 3 cases of Budweiser or PBR try picking up a couple different types of beers off this list and casually explain to your party goers how diverse a Stout s flavors can be If we ve missed any of your favorite types of beers be sure to add them in the

left passes to the right and then oh wait what is he doing Did he just jump over that guy like a hurdle Trick plays like these are what many sports fans live for They only happen on rare occasions but when they do and they are successful they leave the other team fans and even some of their own teammates staring Here is a list of 25 of the best trick plays in sports No 25 South Carolina Tricks Kentucky with Secret Pass Off This is a great trick play South Carolina passes off the ball several times keeping it from being seen by Kentucky and keeping the Wildcats guessing where the ball is while another one of its players runs down the field to get in position to catch and score No 24 Isolation by the Redskins In this move the Washington Redskins create an isolation to give their players time and space to make the touchdown While the maneuver didn t work this particular time it was still obviously a little confusing and surprising for the other team No 23 Team Catches Opponent Off Guard In this trick play the team in white seems to catch the team in black off guard with their only half ready appearance on the field which gives one player the chance to run down the field while their quarterback can set up the pass without being worried about being tackled No 22 Keep Away In this classic baseball trick play a member of the team in the infield pretends to throw the ball back to the pitcher but actually keeps the ball When the runner thinks he s safe and begins to lean away from the base the infielder still with the ball runs up and tags him out Classic trickery on this team s part No 21 Alabama Makes Fake Run Against Arkansas In this awesome trick play an Alabama player secretly hands off the ball to a teammate behind him but continues to run down the field as if he has the ball and is going for the touchdown While the rest of the Arkansas team chases down the player they think has the ball the guy actually with the ball sets up a beautiful pass and throws it to another open teammate down the field allowing Alabama to score No 20 Pretend Trip Up and Loss of Ball In this quick little soccer play the player with the ball pretends to trip over the ball as he is dribbling but really kicks it between the legs of the two guys defending him setting himself up to take the shot and score on goal No 19 The Pop and Roll In this beautiful trick play Bethel College s quarterback pops the ball up and back behind himself to one of his receivers who is then able to keep himself upright just enough to score No 18 Cleveland Browns Secret Handoff In a series of confusing and lightning fast handoffs the Cleveland Browns are able to conceal the whereabouts of the ball and run the ball down the field and score No 17 The Fake Field Goal In this classic trick play LSU fakes a field goal and then runs in for the touchdown No 16 Fake Lacrosse Pass Off Similar to the classic hidden ball trick in baseball in this trick play a player pops the ball up as if he s passing it off to a teammate but in all actuality still has possession of the ball He s then able to score while everyone else is looking the other way Very sneaky No 15 Pretend Fumble and Recover The Patriots fake a fumble to distract their opponents and when one of their teammates has had a chance to run up the field and get open they recover it and pass for the score No 14 Ole Miss Secret Handoff Ole Miss pulls one of the greatest secret pass offs of all time in this play At the beginning of the play they hike the ball to one player who then immediately while still crouched down hands it off to another and then runs like he still has the ball The guy actually with the ball is then able to easily set up and execute a run earning Ole Miss a touchdown No 13 The Fake Throw In this trick play the pitcher pretends to throw to his teammate guarding the base and when everyone runs for the ball that wasn t actually thrown the pitcher runs after and tags out the player on that base No 12 Hidden Ball Lacrosse Trick This may be one of the greatest fake passing runs ever to be played in lacrosse In this play Boston creates a fake handoff tricking the goalie and allowing it to scoreThe play was so smooth and secretive that the other team didn t even seem to know that the other player didn t actually have the ball No 11 Is There Something Wrong with the Ball Is there something wrong with the ball coach Nope that s just a ploy this team used to trick its opponent into inaction in this play No 10 Cleveland Browns Secret Pass and Score Here is another amazing trick play from the Cleveland Browns In this one the Browns pass it off shortly and secretly several times to keep the other team guessing where the ball has gone While they re doing this Brian Robiskie runs down the field and gets open to catch the pass and score a touchdown No 9 UC Irvine Gets LSU with Hidden Ball Trick In this amazing trick play a player from UC Irvine knows he has no hope of getting the ball to third base before an LSU player touches it so he fakes a throw to the base After the fake he ran up and tagged the runner at second base it was so convincing and well done that the umpire called the LSU player out actually believing he was tagged out even though it was late No 8 Presbyterian College Trick Play Against Wake Forest This is what I would like to call a bounce pass and no it isn t a basketball trick It s actually a football trick In this play one player bounces the ball across the field to his teammate making the other team believe there has been an incomplete pass But the ball is actually recovered and while all of that distraction was going on another player got into the perfect position to catch the still live ball and score a touchdown No 7 Fake Catch and Throw In this foreign baseball game an outfielder pretends to catch what was nearly a home run and then proceeds to throw the ball back to the infield keeping the runners from advancing as far as they could have No 6 Left Fake This dodge is so effective and convincing that the player is able to shake off all defenders and run the ball for 98 yards down the field No 5 The Fake Pass Around This is the greatest trick lacrosse play ever In it one team pretends to pass the ball around and around but in all actuality only one player keeps the ball in his pocket Then when the other team is thoroughly confused about where the ball actually is they go for the score No 4 Fake Punt and Touchdown Here is an great example of how effective the fake punt can be In this clip the team running the play was actually able to score a touchdown off the fake No 3 Wrong Ball Play This is one hilarious and amazing trick play Here the maroon team fakes like the ball it has is not the game ball and then hands the ball off to the quarterback While the other team is confused about why the ball isn t the right one the quarterback runs down the field and scores No 2 Pretend Fall This is one tricky and potentially dangerous trick play One player approaching the ball pretends to fall while another player comes up from behind and then steals the ball from his fallen teammate creating confusion about who really has the ball on the field I wonder how many people have gotten kicked or hit in the head with the ball in this play No 1 The Walk Up This is by far the greatest trick play ever to have been used legally in a game Here the quarterback is gently handed the ball and begins to just walk forward while the rest of his team stays in starting position making it look like the play hasn t started yet which causes the other team not to move either Once the quarterback has cleared the defensive line he takes off running full sprint and scores with no one in his way to stop him rankings\/list,

Arizona "",""body"":""Posted by David Porter on Saturday November 26 2011 7 Comments Apparently no one is absolutely certain where the term brunch came into being The word is a portmanteau which linguistics describe as a blend of two or more words breakfast lunch into a new word Some have suggested that the term was coined in Britain in 1895 to describe a Sunday meal for Saturday night carousers While others suggest it was an early 20th century New York reporter allegedly speaking of the typical mid day eating habits of a newspaper reporter In my Midwestern upbringing brunch was done on Sundays It usually occurred with family and or friends after church and involved a massive spread of mouth watering entr\u00e9es As Scottsdale and Phoenix are both significant tourist destinations we thought it would be fun to compile the top 10 Sunday brunches in Scottsdale and Phoenix For days Carol scoured Google to find newspaper articles blogs magazine articles and even a little word of mouth to compile our list We then set ourselves upon the arduous task somebody s gotta do it of personally experiencing each and every one of our choices Nearly 100 mouthwatering photographs of Scottsdale and Phoenix Sunday brunches First off we decided that this wasn t going to be a this one s better than that one type of deal but rather a comprehensive sharing of ten very different Sunday brunch experiences Furthermore our Sunday brunches are listed in no particular order They are merely presented in the order that we experienced them We are a website that loves to share experiences and below you will find a great many photographs of some of the most tantalizing food known to man We sampled items like traditional Scottish haggis blue corn pancakes with desert

you to know that blowing your load on the faces of blindfolded underage girls who think they re participating in a facial cream marketing study is not fraud or any other crime no matter what the Arizona Court of Appeals said last month He also wants you to know he was framed Whether he did it or not he s serving a seven year sentence because of the creative legal work of a Pima County prosecutor Brad Roach In the summer of 2000 Roach was assigned to prosecute Tyrone Henry after two teenage girls said he lured them to his home to try out a product called White Dew facial cream he was developing Instead of exfoliation they said they got ejaculation The girls 15 and 16 years old at the time said Henry showed them examples of women with clumpy white cream on their faces and then blindfolded them The girls said they heard heavy breathing and Henry say It s coming and then felt a thick warm substance applied to their faces They said he took photos paid them 10 a piece and convinced them to make follow up appointments Thinking about it later they realized they d been hoodwinked and called the police Roach admits the hardest part of the case was figuring out what charge he could hang on Henry It wasn t sexual assault because he didn t touch the girls sexually and they didn t touch him And it wasn t indecent exposure because the girls were blindfolded It was fascinating Roach said I don t want to say it was a once in a lifetime case but it s only once in awhile do you get something this bizarre In the end the only charge Roach could get to stick was fraudulent scheme and artifice The Division II of the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that Roach had made the right decision knocking down Henry s appeal It was a huge loophole Roach said No one in the Legislature had ever thought of it It s not the sort of crime that had come up before A 30 YEAR OLD WITH A degree in political science and one of the first black columnists for the Arizona Daily Wildcat Henry defended himself in court arguing that it couldn t be fraud since he didn t cheat them out of money or property The court disagreed finding that he duped them in order to obtain sexual gratification which could be considered a fraudulent benefit under state law I was incredulous absolutely incredulous Henry said recently in a phone interview from the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence We ve all been in night clubs You know how guys lay it on thick to lure girls back to their rooms Under this ruling that would be illegal because they achieve some sort of sexual gratification based on lies Henry said he will appeal next to the Arizona Supreme Court According to Roach Henry will probably keep the state appeals attorneys hands full Henry and his mother Raye Stiles he said are bulldog litigators The thing to understand about Tyrone and his mother is that they re very active in weeding out people they perceive to be treating them unfairly Roach said How that s played out is that they ve filed complaints against nearly everyone in the Pima County Attorney s Office the trial court the appeals court the clerk of the court and the court reporters I didn t even know you could file a complaint against court reporters In person Stiles doesn t have much hard edge She s a lady in all senses of the word and it makes discussing pornography with her difficult A year before Tyrone was brought up on charges of child porn possession Shortly after Stiles who didn t even know it was called lobbying at the time successfully convinced the Arizona Legislature to loosen the state s illegal Internet porn statutes At the time she claimed Pima County was prosecuting innocent folk for possessing illegal material that had been sent to their e mail accounts as spam Although she was dismayed when she learned her son was running a porn site she believes in his innocence Henry claims there was no scam True he was operating the WhiteDewOriginalFacials comWhiteDewOriginalFacials com Web site but that was just his perfectly legal shot at the American Dream ADULT WEB SITES cater to a wide variety of specific fetishes The culmination of oral sex the cumshot is where Henry said he found his niche He went online in January 2000 In the first month he only took in 800 but by June he was pulling in 1 200 a month If he was still in operation he believes he d be making between 15 000 and 20 000 a month Henry advertised for models in the Wildcat and hung fliers in campus laundry rooms When potential models called he said he would explain what his Web site was about show them examples and they d sign two contracts one for terms of compensation and the other a photo release He had previously dealt with about 10 models each of whom earned between 100 and 200 an hour Henry says the two teenagers knew exactly what they were getting into and they wanted the money Once they got to my home I figured out in the course of speaking with them that they were not adults and seized everything Henry said They created a ruse to get that money for very little work I think they got mad at me because I busted them The girls also testified that while blindfolded they saw a camera flash several times Henry s side of the story is that the girls gave him a sob story about how they needed the money so he snapped a headshot of one of the girls and paid them 20 Henry s story is corroborated by the prosecution s evidence When the police searched his home they found between 300 and 500 photos of women in various stages of getting cum on their faces However the only photo of the girls upturned was a single nonsexual frame on an undeveloped roll of film In order to compensate for this weakness in the state s argument Roach supplied the jury other facial images from Henry s Web site gallery Henry protested this in his appeal In a separate unpublished ruling the Appeals Court denied hearing the complaint on procedural grounds In all the sole material evidence in the case was a globule of his sperm found on one girl s sweater Henry claims the girls were playing with everything in his apartment including his laundry basket I m a red blooded American man and I operate an adult site if you look through my clothes you re going to find semen Henry says It s more or less a game of he said they said except what they said fit with Henry s MO The girls testimony matched that of several UA students who told the police a year before they d been conned by Henry Stiles points to foul play She said it s no coincidence that police arrested her son in the White Dew case the day after she threatened to file a complaint against the prosecuting attorney in the child porn offense Raye also says the prosecution may have had racist motives Frankly I didn t even know he was black until months into the case Roach said Roach says there are people in his own office who find it hard to believe that these girls could possibly be so stupid I ve got to come out on the girls defense he said We as a society don t teach girls to be as assertive as they should Teenage girls especially are in a position of low self esteem Tyrone s a good con man He s good at what he did and he s very smart It s easy for us not being in their place to say they re stupid I don t really believe they deserve blame a case involving a pornographer and two teenage girls highlights a legal gray area. crime, porn, tucson news, tucson politics, tucson newspaper, tucson weekly, tucson elections, tucson arts, jim nintzel, mari herreras,

- hans villarica - health - the atlantic how the unrelenting threat of death shapes our behavior"",""body"":""To investigate the effect of mortality awareness researchers behind the influential terror management theory first experimented with judges and prostitutes The Garden of Death 1896 Hugo Simberg Studies on how we cope with the inevitability of death or terror management have a fundamental flaw they lack a control group It s impossible to test if or how a person changes their beliefs or behavior when reminded of their mortality because our awareness of this human condition never ceases Our brain s superfrontal gyrus sees to this neurologically while culture and our physicality highlight it further with books like the Bible and with every new wrinkle To examine death despite this conundrum psychologists at the University of Kansas in 1989 did what academics do best they rationalized the problem away Just as philosopher Jean Paul Sartre affirmed man s existence through his own Cartesian tautology I am I exist I think therefore I am Jeff Greenberg Sheldon Solomon and Tom Pyszczynski simply assumed that there is a universal baseline cognizance of the threat of death and then investigated the instances when death was on people s minds more than usual Decades later hundreds of published academic papers have shown that worrying about death affects everything from our prejudices and voting patterns to how likely we are to exercise or use sunscreen More broadly they ve proven Greenberg and company s original terror management theory right all along that people deal with death by upholding worldviews that are larger and longer lasting than themselves and opposing anyone or anything that violates these cultural anxiety buffers In the Q A below Greenberg reflects on his team s pioneering work in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology PDF He elucidates the intricacies of their theory recalls how prostitutes and judges proved invaluable in their first few experiments and shares the curious way their research which easily became big in Europe finally caught on in the U S What was the original intent of your research As social psychology graduate students at the University of Kansas back in 1980 Sheldon Tom and I felt that our field had become narrowly focused on questions far removed from the whys and hows of everyday life We didn t buy the prevailing view in psychology at the time that people are essentially information processors guided by cognitive schemas and heuristics because we were raised by working class families surrounded by joy and anger sibling love and rivalry passion and sarcasm The people we knew were driven by ethnic regional and occupational pride and conflict and weren t dispassionate androids So one broad intent of our research was to encourage the field to think outside the lab and consider the basic motivations that guide people s actions out in the real world A more specific intent was to develop a way to test terror management theory or TMT The theory is a formal elaboration of ideas that had been floating around since at least the time of the ancient historian Thucydides and that were first introduced in psychology by Otto Rank Basically the idea goes the fear of death drives people to maintain faith in their own culture s beliefs and to follow the culture s paths to an enduring significance that will outlast their own physical death often to the detriment of others who seem to block their pursuit of these goals Could you explain the theory further with an example or illustration TMT began with two simple observations about human beings First humans share with other mammals many biological systems oriented toward keeping themselves alive Included among these is a fight flight freeze response to imminent threat of death usually in humans accompanied by the subjective experience of terror Second unlike other mammals adult human brains have highly developed prefrontal lobes that allow them to realize that no matter what sooner or later death will come Thus part of the human condition is living with a desire to continue to live and an inherent fear of death on the one hand and on the other the knowledge that this desire will inevitably be thwarted and that what is feared will inevitably occur The theory consequently posits that this existential predicament creates an ever present potential to experience a terror of no longer existing As children develop cognitively they begin to understand the threat of death says Greenberg Their basis of security shifts from the parents to large cultural concepts such as deities and ideals As this awareness of mortality dawned on our ancestors they were drawn to belief systems that helped them continue to function with equanimity These cultural worldviews portrayed the world as a meaningful purposeful place in which death is not the ultimate end Until very recently these worldviews virtually always included the idea of a literal afterlife for some aspect of oneself a soul but also included modes of transcending death via permanent symbolic marks of the self such as heroic deeds great achievements memorials and heirs These worldviews are typically constructed such that qualifying for these literal and symbolic modes of immortality require being a valued contributor to the culture Not coincidentally this mirrors the way children develop and sustain a sense of psychological security Born helpless and dependent their first basis of security is parental love But within the first year or so this protective love becomes dependent on being good and thus of value in the eyes of the seemingly omnipotent parents As children develop cognitively they begin to understand that the threat of death lurks behind their early fears of big dogs monsters the dark and so forth Their basis of security shifts from the parents to large cultural concepts such as deities their nation and cultural ideals That is from being good little boys and girls in the eyes of their parents to being good valued Christians or atheists Americans or Germans artists or scientists The result of this socialization process is fully enculturated adults who sustain psychological security despite knowing how vulnerable and mortal they are by maintaining two psychological constructs our faith in our worldview and our sense of self worth How did everything come about As grad students we knew from the existing evidence in social psychology that people seemed to protect their self esteem and are prone to be biased against out groups but no one in our field was explaining why So we started looking outside our field for answers and we found them in a 1973 book by cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker called The Denial of Death We found his dazzling interdisciplinary synthesis of ideas terrifying compelling and able to answer those why questions and indeed explain much of what we knew about human behavior including such matters as the ascent of Hitler in Germany After reading his other books and the key scholarly work he built upon we tried to capture the essence of his rich analysis in a simple formulation which we dubbed terror management theory The tricky part in assessing TMT was that it assumes that while all humans are driven to stay alive they are at the same time aware that death is inevitable Hence all cognitively able humans fear their mortality and must cope with this fear But since this unconscious fear is a constant not a variable how do you test an idea this big based on a constant universal of the human condition As we struggled with this problem Deb Lyon a 30 year old undergrad I was supervising wanted to study judicial decision making She told me that fortunately she was dating a municipal court judge who was willing to encourage his colleagues to participate in a study It struck me that judges uphold the culture s beliefs by punishing those who violate them If fear of mortality motivates upholding cultural beliefs then perhaps the more people are thinking about death the more they will uphold those beliefs by treating an alleged cultural violator more harshly So I told Deb Let s give the judges some personality measures prompt them about their mortality and then have them make a judgment of a hypothetical case typical for them in this case setting bond for an alleged prostitute The results exceeded our expectations Judges reminded of their mortality set an average bond of 455 while judges not so reminded set an average bond of 50 Many subsequent studies have shown that reminders of death arouse negative responses to others who violate or challenge our own worldview supporting one basic implication of TMT that our need for terror management plays a substantial role in prejudice and intergroup conflict What other questions have been answered since TMT was first introduced After hundreds of studies many questions have indeed been answered Research guided by TMT has revealed how concerns about mortality influence many types of human beliefs and behavior bad things like prejudice intergroup conflict terrorism and aggression largely good things like achievement risk taking art and creativity very personal things like sex and other bodily activities health related lifestyle choices cancer prevention and mental health problems matters of practical import like marketing consumerism robotics and environmentalism and a host of other aspects of life such as legal decision making patriotism political preferences romantic relationships parenting and religious belief A character in one of Philip Roth s novels nicely sets up the fundamental question TMT research addresses In every calm and reasonable person there is a hidden second person scared witless about death TMT asks how do most of us keep that second person hidden most of the time Studies revealed that when people consciously think about death they just want to get it out of their minds largely by convincing themselves as my colleague Steve Chaplin puts it Not me not now They say I m young I m healthy I m going to start eating right But when death is on the fringes of consciousness threatening to pop up we keep it at bay by leaning on the defenses we learned as children We try to comfort ourselves I m good so I m protected I m special I m part of something great I last I m above the fray an eternal soul not a mere material thing Two Old Men Eating Soup between 1819 1823 Francisco Goya So people are more proactive when it comes to surviving when they consciously think of death And in contrast when they have unconscious thoughts about their mortality they become more existential in their thinking and more beholden to their beliefs in their behavior When people consciously think about death they either act proactively to forestall it eat healthy water exercise or rationalize why it won t be a problem for a long time I take Lipitor I ll quit smoking soon or just try to distract themselves by turning on the TV calling a friend or having a drink The goal is just to get those thoughts out of consciousness When thoughts of death are activated outside of consciousness it s not that people become more existential in their thinking since they re not thinking about death at all Rather they bolster the psychological resources that they have learned to use to cope with the existential problem of death their worldview and sense of significance And so when death is close to mind after watching an action flick hearing about a celebrity death reading about an act of terrorism online noting a weird spot or new wrinkle driving past a cemetery people become more adamant in their beliefs and get extra motivated to distance themselves from their physicality and to assert their symbolic value their intellect achievements and so forth They increase prejudice and aggression against others who are different They reject the physical aspects of sex avoid bodily activities and use euphemisms for them They show off their skills smarts fitness and generosity And indeed research has shown all of these things Where is the line between a simple reminder of death and consciously thinking about death Does one lead to the other or not necessarily The conscious proactive or evasive defenses are only likely to be activated by consciously thinking about your own death But most reminders of death that we are exposed to at least fleetingly enter consciousness and that s more than enough to activate our unconscious defenses We can t be absolutely certain conscious thought of death will always lead to unconscious defense but the existing evidence suggests that the answer is likely yes Even if a reminder of death isn t consciously noticed any way people are led to think of death is likely sooner or later to trigger unconscious efforts to bolster one s worldview or self worth We have shown for example that simply subliminally flashing the word death on a computer screen to Americans for 28 milliseconds is enough to amplify negative reactions to an author who criticizes the U S Is there any other way to be terrorized besides by death such that the theory still holds Neither the theory nor the research implies that mortality is the only factor that worries people or motivates their behavior However our evidence shows that the ways people keep their concerns about mortality at bay play a role in a wide range of aspects of human behavior that seem on the surface to have nothing to do with death For years at conferences people looked at us generally from a safe distance as the death guys says Greenberg We used to console ourselves with We re big in Europe since in the U S we didn t get a whole lot of attention until after 9 11 For example we ve found that the fear of death plays a significant role in many phobias not just fears of things that can kill you like germs spiders and heights but also social phobias because they raise concerns about being embarrassed or ridiculed and so with self esteem In one study we found that reminders of mortality increase social reticence in socially anxious people And another study found that when participants expected to have to present an ill prepared speech to an audience thoughts of death became more likely to enter consciousness What questions remain unanswered Many questions remain How do the conscious ways we think about and react to death affect our unconscious reactions to it Can extensive conscious contemplation of death or other forms of heightened death awareness make people less reliant on cultural belief systems and a sense of personal significance to manage their fears Can knowledge of our shared mortality be used to reduce rather than intensify intergroup conflict How does our need for terror management affect how we humans treat other animals Can knowledge of TMT facilitate growth and compassion and help people become more in touch with and in control of the choices they make in their lives How do you feel about these lingering issues Sometimes I think they re exciting to consider and important to try to answer Other times they bring death thoughts closer to my consciousness I quickly defend my enduring significance by noting that science involves a continuous process of discovery and assessment and the best theories continue to generate interesting new questions and issues decades or even centuries later thus ensuring my symbolic immortality until the field of psychology is completely obliterated along with the rest of the human species whether by environmental depletion or poisoning nuclear holocaust or perhaps like Tyrannosaurus rex by comet Come to think of it only then will there be no more questions Any pet peeves or ways in which TMT has been misused or misunderstood There is a tendency for researchers to focus in on the nanoparticles that make up the atoms that make up the molecules that make up the bark on the trees rather than on the bark or the trees no less the forest I think some researchers focus in so narrowly on a specific finding from one specific study that they don t really think deeply about the theory or the larger context of hundreds of other studies and data from anthropology archeology history and other fields that are all pertinent to what the theory was developed to explain A lot of people in our field and I am sure other sciences as well jump into research prematurely and are more concerned with quickly making names for themselves than they are with good scholarship and advancing knowledge I think there s a theory that could explain this Yes we now know of at least one On that note what was the initial reaction to the research and what has been its long term impact on the field and to you personally Immediately after its publication the work had some impact in the press but seemed to engender mainly puzzlement or disdain within academic psychology Most psychological scientists at the time were trained to view people and science narrowly and to be suspicious of big theories a vestige of the anti Freudian stance that began to take hold in academic psychologists in the 1960s In contrast we were proposing a big theory of human motivation based on a combination of existential philosophy and of all things psychoanalytic theorizing along with influences from anthropology and sociology On top of that most people in our field were living largely in denial of death For years at conferences people looked at us generally from a safe distance as the death guys We used to console ourselves with We re big in Europe since in the U S we didn t get a whole lot of attention until after 9 11 I recall at a conference the month after the attacks a very prominent social psychologist stopping me briefly and saying OK now I know what you re talking about as if death didn t exist or somehow wasn t a problem until 9 11 Over time I like to think TMT has helped open the field up to theorizing about and empirically investigating the roles of the unconscious motivation culture religion and existential concerns in human behavior But I am more focused on the impact I hope it has on people in their daily lives and on professionals who may find it useful to promote physical and mental health and social progress Personally I also hope that the understanding of human beings this research supports that we re all vulnerable creatures clinging to fragile beliefs to handle the existential predicament inherent in being human has helped me become a better more compassionate person It s helped me realize that no matter how absurd someone else s beliefs seem to me mine are likely no less absurd And if such beliefs are helping that person function with equanimity and not leading him to harm others I should respect them to investigate the effect of mortality awareness,

stumbled into my new favorite coffee shop for The Latest Morning Coffee Ever because I am still adjusting to this new schedule of having everything but also anything to do at any given time One of these days I ll get into all of these changes the way that I stomp on the grave of business casual attire the fact that yes I still get up early each day and shower and put on mascara oh and more relevantly to this site the breakfasts and lunches I put together that is once I get past the yogurt and PB J sandwich phase though no promises that will be be happening any time soon but for now suffice it to say that I am still in the Adjustment Phase Hence the 12 30 p m morning coffee As it was obviously time for lunch but still my internal screams for delicious bitter cold coffee demanded to be placated my stomach was grumbling as I walked in and I had zero resistance when my hand literally bumped into the jar of chocolate hazelnut biscotti while going to order a much more earnest skim latte And while that wee biscotti was quite delicious especially once dunked in my coffee it served to remind me that I am so overdue to make a batch of real biscotti What do I mean by real biscotti What s so wrong with the almond and parmesan black pepper versions I ve told you about before Pretty much while you can still call them biscotti biscotti meaning twice baked which they indeed are they re not the type of biscotti you d get in Italy because they have butter in them making them more cookie like rather than just eggs as a binder making them snappier and more dunking friendly They re also generally less sweet and with have significantly less fat in them if you re into those kinds of bathing suit season friendly things I am lying and Alex has called me on it I don t dunk things I have an issue with crumbs floating in beverages even Oreo crumbs in a glass of milk I am obviously dead inside What I meant to say is that I am sure it would be delicious if you dunked it in coffee if your name isn t Deb and you are not brimming with neurosis One year ago Pearl Couscous with Olives and Roasted Tomatoes Chocolate Hazelnut BiscottiAdapted from The New York Times 12 12 93 This New York Times recipe is as old as time I wish I could tell you how many recipes for biscotti I dug through before finding a couple that didn t have butter in them but I m not sure I can even count that high Suffice it to say it took me to an article from 1993 a year that biscotti were all the rage but probably not for me as I was in high school Sob They are mildly sweet and chocolaty they re the exact opposite of a molten chocolate cake on the indulgent chocolate obsession sliding scale They re also quite easy to put together if you promise to watch out for one thing this is the stickiest dough I have ever worked with and you cannot have too much flour down on your surface Total time 1 hourMakes about 60 biscotti 1 cup whole hazelnuts preferably blanched2 1 2 cups flour plus flour for work surface1 2 cup Dutch style cocoa powder1 tablespoon espresso powderPinch of salt1 2 teaspoon baking soda3 4 teaspoon baking powder4 large eggs1 1 3 cups sugar 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Spread hazelnuts on baking sheet and toast about 10 minutes until lightly browned If hazelnuts are not blanched toast them until the skins begin to crack then remove them from oven and wrap them in clean linen or cotton towel not terrycloth Rub hot nuts to remove most of the skin Set toasted nuts aside 2 Sift the flour cocoa espresso powder salt baking soda and baking powder together and set aside 3 Beat eggs lightly just until blended in mixing bowl with whisk or in electric mixer Remove two tablespoons of egg mixture to small dish and set aside Beat sugar into remaining eggs until blended Stir in flour mixture to form soft dough 4 Divide the dough in half and place one portion on a well floured work surface She is not kidding about this With floured hands pat it into a six inch square Scatter half the hazelnuts on the dough and press them into the surface Roll the dough into a cylinder about 2 inches in diameter and 12 to 15 inches long Line the baking sheet with parchment paper and place the roll of dough on the baking sheet Repeat with the remaining dough Brush the tops of both rolls with the reserved egg 5 Place in the oven and bake about 15 minutes until firm to the touch This took me until 20 to 25 minutes Transfer to a cutting board and cut on an angle into slices one half inch thick I found that letting them cool for five minutes made this easier as well as a sharp knife with a tight serrate Return the slices to the baking sheet laying them on their cut sides and return them to the oven Bake another 20 minutes until they are crisp and dry Allow to cool

send future nanobots or other tiny medical devices zooming around the human body according to a preliminary research report Borrowing a page from reproductive biology the proof of principle study offers a peek at how nanotechnology might overcome the problem of supplying energy to the envisioned menagerie of nanobots implants and smart probes aimed at releasing disease fighting drugs monitoring enzymes and performing other medical roles within a patient s body To be biologically compatible these hypothetical devices would need to be formed not from tiny springs and nuts and bolts but from biomedical components At that scale biology provides the best functional motors said Alexander Travis an assistant professor of reproductive biology at Cornell University s Baker Institute for Animal Health But how do you power these kinds of structures One potential answer has come from the tail or flagellum that propels human sperm at a rate of about 7 inches per hour In comparison if a 6 foot man swam the equivalent number of body lengths in an hour his tally of 3 7 miles would smash the American long distance swimming record To supply the energy for its locomotion a sperm cell s tail is essentially studded with tiny assembly lines that produce a high energy compound called ATP Officially known as adenosine triphosphate ATP has been called the universal energy currency of living cells because of its ability to store transfer and release energy When a power source is needed to run processes within a cell say bending and flexing a sperm s flagellum ATP releases its reserves through a process that results in its decay to a simpler chemical form The most efficient producers of ATP are mitochondria the cell s miniature power plants Sperm tails contain a spiraling helix of these mitochondria within the area closest to the sperm s head On the remaining three quarters of its tail however the cell uses an approach based on a pathway called glycolysis in which sugar is broken down into several components including high energy ATP molecules Proteins normally require the freedom to twist bend or change shape to be functional Research by Travis and Cornell colleague Chinatsu Mukai together with other scientists suggests that in sperm the 10 proteins involved in glycolysis have been tweaked so they stick to a solid scaffold like support running the length of the tail while still maintaining their activity Travis and Mukai borrowed that approach to re jigger the proteins so they stuck instead to the surface of a tiny gold chip covered with nickel ions For their research the scientists used mouse sperm proteins as templates for the synthesized versions Human and mouse sperm proteins are closely related After tethering the first two proteins in the pathway to the chip the researchers found that both did well in breaking down glucose and handing the end product to the next protein Compared to versions lacking a surface targeting domain and just randomly glommed onto a structural support the engineered proteins performed especially well Most of the remaining assembly line has yet to be similarly tweaked but Travis and Mukai s work suggests it should be possible We believe it is one of the first if not the first example of building a biological pathway on a manmade surface Travis said The collaborators have a provisional patent for the ATP making strategy though no commercial partners as of yet Like a vehicle running on gasoline the sperm s power production emits waste Fortunately its tail harbors a transport protein that acts like a tailpipe to kick out waste and keep the production cycle going Future nanodevices Travis said could include this transporter to similarly maintain their energy production Maximizing the pathway s efficiency could prove important for future strategies such as filling tiny delivery capsules known as liposomes with cancer fighting drugs and studding their outsides with antibodies that would direct the medical packets to attack specific tumor cells Under that scenario a steady supply of ATP could power the pumps charged with dispensing the medication at a certain rate Other scientists are likewise mining the emerging field of nanotechnology and its largely unrealized potential for delivering high impact devices in ultra small dimensions Recent studies for example have harnessed nanotubes nanodiamonds and magnetic nanoparticles for drug delivery but not yet within humans One group has created a tiny nickel based rod that spins almost like a tiny propeller as it uses ATP Another team led by Carlo Montemagno at the University of Cincinnati is working on a technique that makes ATP from light photons As a veterinarian Travis said his interest in wildlife conservation got him into reproductive biology and research aimed at fighting infertility and exploring birth control methods Through efforts by his lab and others he discovered that one of the most abundant proteins in mammalian sperm hexokinase is also the first enzyme in the glycolysis assembly line on its tail That observation led to questions about the protein s role location and eventually about whether it and its assembly line partners might be useful for other applications Cornell University s emphasis on nanotechnology just kind of clicked with his reproductive biology research Travis said He and Mukai presented the initial results from that scientific pairing in early December at the American Society for Cell Biology s annual meeting held in Washington D C and are now preparing the study for publication Dr Erkki Ruoslahti a nanotechnology researcher and distinguished professor with the La Jolla Calif based Burnham Institute for Medical Research said he was intrigued by the approach and considered it a valid first step It sounds good to me that s the kind of thing that the field needs he said Having some sort of way of being able to power nanodevices is the number one bottleneck in constructing really clever devices The safety of nanotechnology devices has yet to be fully resolved Ruoslahti cautioned that sperm inspired ATP generators would need to overcome the likelihood that the altered proteins would be recognized as foreign by the body s immune system provoking a strong immune response Even so he pointed out that some nanoparticles potentially serving as the basis for savvy devices of the future are already in use including magnetic iron oxide particles used for advanced body imaging These are not pie in the sky technologies Ruoslahti said They re

programming technique that lends itself to a variety of areas not least of which is creating interesting visual images In brief recursion is a technique for breaking a complex problem into smaller and simpler versions of itself this is called the recursive step until the problem is trivial to solve this trivial case is called the base case This Codebox a variety of sketches that will help you explore this fun and interesting technique using simple geometrical concepts Many artists have used recursive themes in their work particularly M C Escher and Rene Magritte This first sketch shows how to create images in the style of Piet Mondrian who is best known for his compositions of colorful rectangles The following program uses recursion to creates a faux Mondrian The base case is simple all you do is draw a filled rectangle with a thick black border the rectangle s color is selected from a small set of primary colors red white yellow etc The recursive step is to break this rectangle and all subsequent rectangles into 4 smaller rectangles by selecting a random point in its interior The following figure should give you an idea of how it works The output will look something like this Finally here s the sketch mondrian pde The piet function is the heart of the program and illustrates how most recursive programs work Here it is Draw a Mondrian inspired image using recursion void piet int x0 int y0 int x1 int y1 int N if N 0 Base case draw a colorful rectangle with a thick black border int sw 3 this is the stroke width for the rectangle s border color c ff0000 00ff00 0000ff ffff00 ffffff Mondrian color palatte fill c int random c length strokeWeight sw rect x0 y0 x1 x0 sw y1 y0 sw else Recursive step break the current rectangle into 4 new random rectangles int i int random x0 x1 int j int random y0 y1 piet x0 y0 i j N 1 upper left rectangle piet i y0 x1 j N 1 upper right rectangle piet x0 j i y1 N 1 lower left rectangle piet i j x1 y1 N 1 lower right rectangle The function accepts 5 arguments the coordinates of the upper left hand corner of a rectangle x0 and y0 the coordinates of the lower right hand corner x1 and x2 and the current recursive depth N The function does two basic things First it tests to see if it s reached the base case when N 0 If so then all it does is draw a rectangle that is randomly colored from the basic Mondrian palette of colors red greed blue yellow and white If it s not the base case then it selects a random point i j inside the current rectangle and then calls piet 4 more times passing in the various coordinates that form the 4 new interior rectangles This divide and conquer approach of having a function that calls itself is the hallmark of recursion Simple recursive processes are often used to create natural looking objects For example we can create a natural looking plant using the following simple recursive process where each plant begins as a straight line This line is replaced with a new branch that consists of the original line plus 3 4 new alternating branches The exact number of branches is determined by a variable you can set This same process is applied recursively for each new branch up to a depth you specify The following figure illustrates the basic idea Lines are represented as vectors A vector consists of an origin point defined by the variables x and y a length defined by the variable r and an angle defined by the variable theta The following figure shows how these variables are related This figure illustrates a few of the simple plants created with this basic process Here s the sketch plant pde Finally I d be remiss without showing the Snowflake curve one of the best known recursive figures The base case is a simple triangle Each edge is then replaced by a new set of 4 line segments that are 1 3 the length of the original line You then repeatedly replace each of these new segments with a new 4 line segment this recursive step The following figure should give you the basic idea of the process The results look like this Here s the sketch snowflake pde Note that you ll need to have the controlP5 contributed library to change the recursive depth often referred to as N to see how it affects the image Unfortunately I had to limit the maximum recursive depth to 6 rather than infinity since the library does not currently support slidebars that extend beyond your

foods and saturated fats in favour of the sort of diet our ape like ancestors once ate Nine volunteers gave it a go and were glad they did so Being locked in the zoo and offered bananas to eat is the kind of extreme diet scenario to wake some of us screaming in the night But that was how a group of volunteers opted to try to cut their blood pressure and cholesterol levels They set up home in a tented enclosure at Paignton Zoo Devon next to the ape house in an experiment filmed for TV The idea says Jill Fullerton Smith who helped organise the trial was that modern diets often dominated by processed foods and saturated fats cause costly health problems For example nearly half Britain s 117 000 annual deaths from coronary heart disease are linked to high cholesterol according to the British Heart Foundation And while the government urges everyone to eat five portions of fruit and veg a day obesity is still rising So could an experiment on ordinary people s lives deliver the healthy eating message Nine volunteers aged 36 to 49 took on the 12 day Evo Diet consuming up to five kilos of raw fruit and veg a day EVO DIET WHAT THEY ATE 5kgs or 2 300 calories of fruit vegetables nuts and honey On a 3 day rotation typically Broccoli carrots radishes Cabbage tomatoes watercress Strawberries apricots bananas Mangoes melons figs plums Satsumas hazelnutsThe regime was devised by nutritionist and registered dietician Lynne Garton and King s College Hospital It was based on research showing such a diet could have health benefits for cholesterol levels and blood pressure because it is made up of the types of foods our bodies evolved to eat over thousands of years Ms Garton looked for inspiration to the plant based diet of our closest relatives the apes and devised a three day rotating menu of fruit vegetables nuts and honey The prescribed menu was safe to eat raw met adult human daily nutritional requirements and provided 2 300 calories between the 2 000 recommended for women and 2 500 for men Volunteers could also drink water In the second week standard portions of cooked oily fish were introduced a nod to a more hunter gatherer lifestyle Among the volunteers was Jon Thornton 36 a driving instructor from Sheffield who had never eaten vegetables from childhood upwards Weighing in at almost 19 stone his typical diet read like the children s book Mr Strong Breakfast was four slices of toast at 10am a bacon sausage and egg sarnie followed fish and chips for tea and a Chinese take away before bed That was before his wife signed up Mr Thornton for the experiment Over 12 days he lost 5 7kg 12 5lbs and reduced his cholesterol by 20 His blood pressure also fell Despite nearly backing out at the start the first day s food arrived in a cool box was raw and he was distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of broccoli he was converted to eating vast portions of fresh fruit and veg I didn t feel any loss of energy I didn t feel ill at all he says It s not a diet you d recommend as a diet itself but it worked to bring my cholesterol and blood pressure down Harmony in campWith so much food bulk and plenty of calories the subjects did not go hungry indeed most failed to finish their daily ration And once they were over the withdrawal from caffeinated drinks and some foods says Ms Garton they enjoyed good energy levels and mood So the moments of unhappiness and grumpiness that the TV crew was primed to capture failed to happen The proved to be a motivated group although the one odorous side effect from all that roughage couldn t be ignored Overall the cholesterol levels dropped 23 an amount usually achieved only through anti cholesterol drugs statins The group s average blood pressure fell from a level of 140 83 almost hypertensive to 122 76 Though it was not intended to be a weight loss diet they dropped 4 4kg 9 7lbs on average The regime provided an education for all and a permanent change for some The main lesson that they took away was to eat more fruit and veg says Ms Garton They also cut salt intake from a group average of 12g a day to 1g against a guideline maximum of 6g and reduced saturated fat which makes cholesterol from 13 to 5 of calories recommended 11 At the same time they increased the soluble fibre which binds cholesterol in the gut so that it is expelled and increased the intake of plant sterols which help to lower cholesterol For Jon life has changed since he was released from the zoo He has gained a little weight but now says he only eats when hungry and knows good food can help health and longevity He can play football because his knees no longer hurt under the extra weight and he goes cycling He even managed to hold out at the most tempting time of year For the first time in 36 years this year I had vegetables with my Christmas dinner he says Usually I say no to them and have a few extra roast potatoes instead human guinea pigs eat "",""url"":""organicconsumers org articles article 3847

Eric s office plights for another time Given our warm weather this week I decided to make a nutty no bake crust to really bring this torte into full Summer mode No oven required And let s be real I really don t want an oven getting in the way of my chocolate fix It s time to cut out the middle man Chilled Double Chocolate Torte The No Bake Version Crust from Healthy Hoggin Chocolate avocado mousse from my Chilled Double Chocolate Torte No Bake Chocolate Crust 2 cups pecans 1 4 cup cocoa powder 2 tbsp coconut oil other light taste oil may work 1 4 cup pure maple syrup 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 2 tsp kosher salt Chocolate Avocado Mousse 2 cups avocado flesh approx 3 small avocados pitted and scooped out 1 3 cup almond milk 2 3 cup pure maple syrup 1 tbsp smooth peanut butter or other nut butter 1 tbsp arrowroot powder 1 4 tsp kosher salt 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 cup 2 tbsp chocolate chips melted 1 4 cup cocoa powder sifted if clumpy Directions 1 Crust Oil a 7 10 inch springform pan and line it with a circle of parchment paper In a food processor pulse the pecans until crumbly Be careful not to over process them as you still want them a bit chunky Now add in the rest of the crust ingredients and pulse until just mixed Scoop mixture onto prepared pan and press down firmly and evenly with slightly wet fingers or a spatula Pop into freezer to set while making the mousse 2 Chocolate mousse Place all mousse ingredients except chocolate chips into food processor Process until smooth In a small bowl melt your chocolate chips in the microwave and scoop melted chocolate into food processor mixture Process until smooth 3 Remove crust from freezer and scoop this mousse on top of crust Smooth out as much as possible and then place in the freezer for 2 hours to firm 4 Once firm remove from freezer and allow to sit on the counter for about 5 10 minutes before serving chilled Place leftover torte in the freezer wrapped and placed in a seal container Note that this torte should be served chilled as it gets soft at room temperature Thanks to Healthy Hoggin s chocolate crust this worked out beautifully No flops no trial 2 3 or 4 Just perfection The chocolate pecan crust adds an irresistible nutty and slightly salty flavour which is a perfect contrast to the rich chocolaty mousse The crust is quite thin when made in a 10 inch pan so next time I might make this in a 7 or 8 inch cake pan for more height It might also be fun to make this in a muffin tin with muffin liners for single servings treats Or in a square pan and cut into bite sized squares It probably goes without saying but when you make individual servings you get to eat one without your guests being the wiser It s a bit more difficult to hide the fact that you already enjoyed a slice of the pie before they came over Or two Not that I m speaking from experience or anything Have yourself a sweet Friday Possibly Related Posts i\u2019m often asked what my favourite vegan dessert is, the

has an enormous reputation but loose understanding in popular culture Learn how it s absorbed and how fast why it s essential to reality TV altercations its paradoxical sexual effects and its life lengthening potential whether red wine or Bud Light Image via TheDeliciousLife Everyone it seems takes their cues on how alcohol affects the mind and body from an eclectic mix of knowledge personal experience pop culture tall tales of long nights the latest studies to make the health news wires and second hand tips You might have gathered that alcohol is a depressant that it s dehydrating that you can drink about one drink an hour and stay relatively sober Some of that is true But much of it depends on a large number of factors Let s dig into some of the things we do and don t know about alcohol Relevant sources are linked where cited but much of the background material comes from Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine new ish Kindle edition linked there It s a science based tome written in a clear language by Stephen Braun and was the main reference for our take on caffeine We re taking a few things for granted here that you understand some of the basics of alcohol consumption blood alcohol content legal limits what it feels like when you ve had too much to drink and the serious illness of alcoholism We re not trying to help you get loaded quicker or drink more for longer periods We re digging into some of the science behind how you and alcohol interact It Works Differently on Full Stomachs Young Women Some Asians and Aspirin Takers Your body sees alcohol as a poison or at least as something it doesn t actually want inside it To fight back and sober you up humans produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase That enzyme gets its shot at your alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and when it reaches your liver primarily On contact it snatches a hydrogen atom off the ethanol molecules in your drink rendering it into non intoxicating acetaldehyde Humans can then use aldehyde dehydrogenase as a kind of clean up crew breaking down the acetaldehyde that s sometimes considered a cause of hangovers along with dehydration For more on the myths versus reality of hangovers see our guide to hangover cures Image via Wikimedia Commons Seems pretty simple no It s a fight between how much you can drink versus how fast your enzymes can bust down your indulgences and their byproducts But many factors affect certain people s production of the two alcohol crushing compounds Alcohol dehydrogenase AD is for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women Young men in fact may have up to 70 to 80 percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol But men s AD effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around 55 or 60 men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal A full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol When you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly Your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the AD in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol Drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than 200 square meters of surface area for absorption into your body Image via peretzpup Another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics Your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your Friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of Asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance Alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid That changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde With excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases Your own genetic makeup of AD and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion Don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers Aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s AD enzymes In one 1990 study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of 26 percent higher than those who were aspirin free Other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol That also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper Side Note Absorption and Elimination Is a Curve Not a Straight Line Think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights Check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced Blood Alcohol Calculator Your BAC moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than 20 25 percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath It Extends Your Life Kind Of Every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it Plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research researchers followed 1824 people over a total of 20 years as they aged between 55 and 65 Of those who abstained entirely 69 percent died Among those who drank in moderate amounts 41 percent died which was 23 percent less than the light drinkers Even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just 61 percent passing away during the study period How could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life Popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of HDL good cholesterol But Jonah Lehrer at Wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real It relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant What does this have to do with longevity In recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects Direct PDF link of loneliness It turns out to be really dangerous We are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease At this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical But given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships And it s these relationships that help keep us alive Image via LINXBAS Theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social Diet Coke drinker But it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit It Doesn t Kill Brain Cells but Does Inhibit Them It s true that at high concentrations like the nearly 100 percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else But given that the blood reaching your brain is only at 0 08 percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say 0 25 percent if you ve just closed a major deal in Tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter Don t believe it A major study by Grethe Jensen and colleagues in 1993 matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes There were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups Misconception Junction tackles Jensen s study and the topic in more depth What alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate It infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages Alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on Keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help As Stephen Braun puts it in Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine Substances such as cocaine and LSD work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits Alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade It affects practically everything around it Side Note That s Also Why It Uh Inhibits Sex The studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as Shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving It s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax Side Note 2 Alcohol is Particularly Effective at Inhibiting Memories Like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood But it does seem linked to N Methyl D aspartic acid or NMDA the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to Braun Studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember It varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious 0 2 percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories It Makes Other People Seem More Intentional If you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm The same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening But give yourself any amount of time and you ll generally think out all the reasons something could have happened avoiding your natural intentionality bias and preventing heated arguments with otherwise close friends bar altercations and 80 percent of all reality show plots Image via terren in Virginia But as you might have guessed that reasoned thinking gets lost when there s a night s worth of alcohol moving through your brain In the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin researchers detail a study with 92 men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol All the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos The men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for 30 minutes After that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions He deleted the email She looked for her keys She tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental Ars Technica sums up the results Nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly However when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were The study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them It s a Terrible Sleep Aid Ever heard the term nightcap People have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some Once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow Image via Ella s Dad Just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings It takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial REM sleep along with your more passive general resting If you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to 5 hours to break down half a dose If it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to Braun s Buzz What aspect of alcohol do you wish you had an explanation for What s a drinking lesson

Central and South America and it was named after the capital city of French Guinea South America Christopher Columbus introduced these peppers to Europe after finding them in the Caribbean Cayenne peppers were soon taken to Africa and Asia where they became an essential ingredient in the cuisine Cayenne pepper has been used in traditional folk medicine for the treatment of respiratory tract infections asthma digestive ailments cancers fevers and sore throats The healing properties of cayenne pepper are primarily due to the substance capsicum which is also responsible for its hot and spicy flavor Nutrients in Cayenne Pepper Cayenne pepper is an excellent source of vitamin A It s a good source of vitamin C and dietary fiber Cayenne for Arthritis In a 4 week double blind study of 70 patients with osteoarthritis and 31 with rheumatoid arthritis it was concluded that capsaicin cream is a safe and effective treatment for arthritis Another double blind study suggest that capsaicin is a safe and potentially useful treatment for painful osteoarthritis of the hands Cayenne for Digestive Health Cayenne has been and is still used for digestive problems in traditional Chinese Japanese Korean and Ayurvedic medicines Studies have shown cayenne or the ingredient capsaicin to be effective in relieving the symptoms of dyspepsia Capsaicin also offers protection against peptic ulcers and against injury to the stomach lining caused by aspirin Cayenne for Pain Relief Capsaicin from cayenne peppers is used effectively in many areas of pain relief Capsaicin extracted from hot peppers and applied to the skin as the active ingredient in a cream or ointment is an effective over the counter pain remedy In addition in a 1991 study at the University of Florence Italy 39 men and women suffering from cluster headaches a form of migraine obtained relief by squirting a capsaicin containing solution into the nostril on the headache side of the face It has been shown to be effective in acute pain relief following surgical procedures such as inguinal hernia repair mastectomy and other cancer surgery There have been several preliminary studies and a large double blind study supporting evidence of the effectiveness of capsaicin for pain relief in individuals with post herpetic neuralgia the pain following an outbreak of herpes zoster or shingles Results of studies also suggest that topical capsaicin cream is a safe and effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy the pain that is thought to result from injury to the micro blood vessels supplying nerves In one study topically applied capsaicin was equally effective as amitriptyline antidepressant drug with side effects sometimes prescribed for pain relief for relief of the pain of diabetic neuropathy A preliminary study has suggested that topically applied capsaicin cream may decrease neck pain but a double blind placebo controlled trial is needed to substantiate this result The capsaicin used to relieve pain is a purified medical grade product extracted from peppers Hot peppers themselves do not relieve pain and should never be applied to skin or mucous membranes Cayenne for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Cayenne pepper reduces atherosclerosis by inhibiting platelet aggregation blood clots and increasing fibrinolytic activity which is the ability to prevent blood clots that can be the cause of heart attack pulmonary embolism and stroke Cayenne for Weight Loss Epidemiological data data hatgered from population studies indicates the consumption of capsaicin rich foods such as cayenne and other peppers is associated with a lower prevalence of obesity In a human study conducted at the Division of Kinesiology in Qu\u00e9bec Canada the addition of red pepper to meals significantly increased diet induced thermogenesis heat production and lipid oxidation the burning of fat for energy In a second study results show that the intake of red pepper decreases appetite In recent research there is evidence that capsaicin from cayenne and other chili peppers may inhibit the growth of fat cells by activating AMP activated protein kinase AMPK which is found in muscle and other human tissue AMPK has been found to regulate eating behavior and energy expenditure and AMPK activation also stimulates hepatic and skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation Cayenne for Sore Throats For sore throats add a pinch of cayenne powder to 25 ml lemon juice Dilute With hot water add honey and use as a gargle Do not exceed the stated dose Adverse Reactions from Cayenne In certain individuals Capsicum may affect the lining of the gut care should be taken with the drug during pregnancy and lactation References 1 The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods by Michael Murray Joseph Pizzorno and Lara Pizzorno 2 Benders

cake filled with lavender ganache and frosted with cream cheese icing On my other website FoodPornDaily I often get email requests for the food featured in the daily images An old one that I still get requests for is the Earl Grey chocolate cake There is something magical about the way that Earl Grey tea combines with chocolate to make a mildly floral yet roasty fudgy flavor that my tongue just can t get enough of And seriously I m not a chocolate lover Don t get me wrong I m not a hater either It s just that I can either take or leave chocolate I never crave it but if it appears in front of me in a delicious dessert I m not going to say no to at least a bite This cake appears to be the exception I find myself craving it every few weeks but I m gonna blame that on my deep seated love of Earl Grey tea In the recipe below I call for lavender extract in the ganache To be frank when I made this and put the extract in both the cream cheese frosting and the ganache I thought the whole thing was a little too floral I don t mind hints of floral in my food but if it s like I m eating a f cking wedding bouquet I d rather not have it in my mouth ya know Anyway for the recipes that follow I am suggesting that you NOT use the lavender extract in the cream cheese frosting and only use a small amount in the ganache If you don t have it on hand then I wouldn t make a special trip out to find it Just omit the extract all together and you still won t be disappointed in the cake Oh yeah and don t worry about dying the cream cheese frosting purple turns out people will likely make fun of you for making a Barney cake This post is dedicated to Samantha Penney and Gwen Miller for continuing to remind me to get this recipe posted Thanks ladies sometimes I need a little kick in the pants Fudgy Earl Grey Chocolate Cake Tea leaves from 6 bags of Earl Grey tea ground into a fine powder using a spice mill coffee grinder1 stick 1 2 cup butter1 1 4 cups cake flour3 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 1 2 cups packed brown sugar1 1 2 tsp baking soda2 1 2 tsp baking powder1 2 tsp salt3 eggs2 cups buttermilk Lavender Ganache recipe follows Cream Cheese Frosting recipe follows Preheat oven to 325 degrees Grease two 9 inch cake pans with butter then line the bottoms of each pan with a circle of parchment paper Set aside Place butter and tea powder into a small sauce pan over low heat Cook for 10 minutes until the butter has melted and the tea flavors have infused into the butter stirring occasionally Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes While the butter is cooling place the cake flour cocoa powder brown sugar baking soda baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl or bowl of a stand mixer Whisk to combine evenly In a separate bowl beat together the eggs and buttermilk Add buttermilk mixture and the cooled tea infused butter to the bowl with the dry ingredients Whisk or beat until just combined The batter will be slightly lump and that is okay Do not over work the batter or the cake will be tough and dense rather than light and fluffy Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans Bake cakes at 325 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick stuck into the center of the cake comes out clean with only a few crumbs but no batter Cool on a rack for at least one hour To remove cakes from pans run a knife around the edges of the pans to loosen then place a plate over each cake pan and invert onto the plate Peel off parchment paper and discard Place one cake onto serving dish Tuck strips of parchment paper under bottom edges of the cake to protect the serving dish from getting messy while frosting Evenly spread the ganache over top of the first cake Place the second cake over the ganache bottom layer Evenly spread cream cheese frosting over the top and sides of the cake For best results use an offset spatula You may not use all of the frosting Once frosted carefully remove and discard the parchment paper lining the bottom of the cake The cake can be stored covered at room temperature for up to 12 hours before serving or refrigerated for 2 to 3 days Lavender Ganache 4 oz heavy cream6 oz good semi sweet chocolate chopped in chunks or chips 1 tbsp sugar1 4 tsp lavender extract Place chocolate and sugar in a heat proof bowl and set aside Heat cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat Pour simmering cream over chocolate sugar mixture Let sit for 60 seconds then whisk until all chocolate is melted and the ganache is shiny and smooth Add lavender extract and stir until incorporated Let chill for 20 minutes until thickened slightly before using as a filling for cake Basic Cream Cheese Frosting 2 8oz packages cream cheese at room temperature1 stick butter at room temperature16 oz powdered sugar sifted1

Cavalry Store catalogue has nice little Official Issue stamps on all the appropriate items which helps a lot The local surplus places are pretty poor pickings unless you re an experienced shopper but hey check em out yourself on a weekend If nothing else you find lots of cool stuff to examine and they often do carry useful mundane things like camping gear or knives The best I have is U S Cavalry

only one catalogue that would be the one U S Cavalry has official military issue items so listed which makes it easier to pick them out They also have stuff like MREs water purifiers goretex clothing knives flashlights backpacks sleeping bags etc Both places also stock a selection of books on wilderness survival and other esoteric subjects Note a few things in these catalogs may be illegal to carry or in a couple of cases own in California Unless you decide to order something bizarre like a blowgun or nunchaku you shouldn t have any problems but be aware BOTH places I noted sell paramedic shears if anyone is interested The serrated edge referred to is probably the Spyder Edge developed by Spyderco knifes and now ripped off uh I mean proudly used by other manufacturers I believe it s supposed to last longer than a flat edge and cuts better The primary down side is that it requires a special crockstick affair to sharpen when it does get dull but I think this is pretty easy if you have the crockstick set o SI Outdoor Food and Equipment P O Box 3796 Gardena Ca 90247 213 324 8855 They publish a catalog of specials bi monthly It takes several issues of the catalog to get through

500 beach and sport sunscreens with SPF ratings of 30 and higher finds that more than 300 of them about 60 percent provide inadequate UVA protection and are too weak for the European market where manufacturers voluntarily comply with a standard for meaningful UVA protection Risky vitamin A additives Many sunscreen makers still use a form of vitamin A called retinyl palmitate ignoring recent scientific research by the federal Food and Drug Administration indicating the chemical may be photocarcinogenic that it may heighten skin cancer risk when used on sun exposed skin While more definitive research is under way EWG recommends that prudent consumers avoid vitamin A laden sunscreens Sky high SPF claims About 1 in 6 beach and sport sunscreens claim SPFs greater than 50 compared to 1 in 8 in 2009 Yet studies show that high SPF users are exposed to as much or more ultraviolet rays than people who use lower SPF products Why Those big numbers give people a false sense of security They wait too long before reapplying and stay out too long Still no federal sunscreen rules The FDA declared its intent to regulate sunscreens back in 1978 The rules are still in bureaucratic limbo While regulators delay sunscreen makers can sell products that overstate sun protection and underperform in the real world EWG continues to pressure the FDA to issue enforceable rules for sunscreen products Sunscreens Exposed 9 surprising truths Sunscreens prevent sunburns but beyond that simple fact surprisingly little is known about the safety and efficacy of these ubiquitous creams and sprays FDA s failure to finalize its 1978 sunscreen safety standards both epitomizes and perpetuates this state of confusion EWG s review of the latest research unearthed troubling facts that might tempt you to give up on sunscreens altogether That s not the right answer despite the unknowns about their efficacy public health agencies still recommend using sunscreens just not as your first line of defense against the sun At EWG we use sunscreens but we look for shade wear protective clothing and avoid the noontime sun before we smear on the cream Here are the surprising facts 1 There s no consensus on whether sunscreens prevent skin cancer The Food and Drug Administration s 2007 draft sunscreen safety regulations say FDA is not aware of data demonstrating that sunscreen use alone helps prevent skin cancer FDA 2007 The International Agency for Research on Cancer agrees IARC recommends clothing hats and shade as primary barriers to UV radiation and writes that sunscreens should not be the first choice for skin cancer prevention and should not be used as the sole agent for protection against the sun IARC 2001a Read more 2 There s some evidence that sunscreens might increase the risk of the deadliest form of skin cancer for some people Some researchers have detected an increased risk of melanoma among sunscreen users No one knows the cause but scientists speculate that sunscreen users stay out in the sun longer and absorb more radiation overall or that free radicals released as sunscreen chemicals break down in sunlight may play a role One other hunch Inferior sunscreens with poor UVA protection that have dominated the market for 30 years may have led to this surprising outcome All major public health agencies still advise using sunscreens but they also stress the importance of shade clothing and timing Read more 3 There are more high SPF products than ever before but no proof that they re better In 2007 the FDA published draft regulations that would prohibit companies from labeling sunscreens with an SPF sun protection factor higher than SPF 50 The agency wrote that higher values were inherently misleading given that there is no assurance that the specific values themselves are in fact truthful FDA 2007 Scientists are also worried that high SPF products may tempt people to stay in the sun too long suppressing sunburns a late key warning of overexposure while upping the risks of other kinds of skin damage Flaunting FDA s proposed regulation companies substantially increased their high SPF offerings in 2011 Nearly one in five products now lists SPF values higher than 50 compared to only one in eight in 2009 according to EWG s analysis of more than 600 beach and sport sunscreens Among the worst offenders are Walgreens and CVS stores and Neutrogena Walgreens boasts of SPF higher than 50 on nearly half of its sunscreens CVS and Neutrogena make the same misleading claim on about a third of theirs Read more 4 Too little sun might be harmful reducing the body s vitamin D levels Adding to the confusion is the fact that sunshine serves a critical function in the body that sunscreen appears to inhibit production of vitamin D The main source of vitamin D in the body is sunshine and the compound is enormously important to health it strengthens bones and the immune system reduces the risk of various cancers including breast colon kidney and ovarian cancers and regulates at least 1 000 different genes governing virtually every tissue in the body Mead 2008 Over the last two decades vitamin D levels in the U S population have been decreasing steadily creating a growing epidemic of vitamin D insufficiency Ginde 2009a Seven of every 10 U S children now have low levels Those most likely to be deficient include children who are obese or who spend more than four hours daily in front of the TV computer or video games Kumar 2009 Experts disagree on the solution The American Medical Association has recommended 10 minutes of direct sun without sunscreen several times a week AMA 2008 while the American Academy of Dermatology holds that there is no scientifically validated safe threshold level of UV exposure from the sun that allows for maximal vitamin D synthesis without increasing skin cancer risk AAD 2009 Vitamin D supplements are the alternative but there is debate over the proper amount The Institute of Medicine has launched new research to reassess the current guidelines In the meantime your doctor can test your vitamin D levels and give advice on sunshine versus supplements Read more 5 The common sunscreen ingredient vitamin A may speed the development of cancer Recently available data from an FDA study indicate that a form of vitamin A retinyl palmitate when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions NTP 2009 This evidence is troubling because the sunscreen industry adds vitamin A to 30 percent of all sunscreens The industry puts vitamin A in its formulations because it is an anti oxidant that slows skin aging That may be true for lotions and night creams used indoors but FDA recently conducted a study of vitamin A s photocarcinogenic properties the possibility that it results in cancerous tumors when used on skin exposed to sunlight Scientists have known for some time that vitamin A can spur excess skin growth hyperplasia and that in sunlight it can form free radicals that damage DNA NTP 2000 In FDA s one year study tumors and lesions developed up to 21 percent sooner in lab animals coated in a vitamin A laced cream at a concentration of 0 5 than animals treated with a vitamin free cream Both groups were exposed to the equivalent of just nine minutes of maximum intensity sunlight each day It s an ironic twist for an industry already battling studies on whether their products protect against skin cancer The FDA data are preliminary but if they hold up in the final assessment the sunscreen industry has a big problem In the meantime EWG recommends that consumers avoid sunscreens with vitamin A look for retinyl palmitate or retinol on the label Read more 6 Free radicals and other skin damaging byproducts of sunscreen Both UV radiation and many common sunscreen ingredients generate free radicals that damage DNA and skin cells accelerate skin aging and cause skin cancer An effective sunscreen prevents more damage than it causes but sunscreens are far better at preventing sunburn than at limiting free radical damage While typical SPF ratings for sunburn protection range from 15 to 50 equivalent free radical protection factors fall at only about 2 When consumers apply too little sunscreen or reapply it infrequently behaviors that are more common than not sunscreens can cause more free radical damage than UV rays on bare skin Read more 7 Pick your sunscreen nanomaterials or potential hormone disruptors The ideal sunscreen would completely block the UV rays that cause sunburn immune suppression and damaging free radicals It would remain effective on the skin for several hours and not form harmful ingredients when degraded by UV light It would smell and feel pleasant so that people use it in the right amount and frequency Unsurprisingly there is currently no sunscreen that meets all of these criteria The major choice in the U S is between chemical sunscreens which have inferior stability penetrate the skin and may disrupt the body s hormone systems and mineral sunscreens zinc and titanium which often contain micronized or nano scale particles of those minerals After reviewing the evidence EWG determined that mineral sunscreens have the best safety profile of today s choices They are stable in sunlight and do not appear to penetrate the skin They offer UVA protection which is sorely lacking in most of today s sunscreen products Mexoryl SX ecamsule is another good option but it s sold in very few formulations Tinosorb S and M could be great solutions but are not yet available in the U S For consumers who don t like mineral products we recommend sunscreens with avobenzone 3 percent for the best UVA protection and without the notorious hormone disruptors oxybenzone or 4 MBC Scientists have called for parents to avoid using oxybenzone on children due to penetration and toxicity concerns Read more 8 Europe s better sunscreens Sunscreen makers and users in Europe have more options than in the United States In Europe sunscreen makers can select from among 27 chemicals for their formulations compared to 17 in the U S Companies selling in Europe can add any of seven UVA filters to their products but have a choice of only three when they market in the U S European sunscreens could earn FDA s proposed four star top rating for UVA protection while the best U S products would earn only three stars Sunscreen chemicals approved in Europe but not by the FDA provide up to five times more UVA protection U S companies have been waiting five years for FDA approval to use the same compounds Last but not least Europeans will find many sunscreens with strong mandatory UVA protection if proposed regulations in Europe are finalized Under FDA s current proposal Americans will not Read more 9 The 34th summer in a row without final U S sunscreen safety regulations In the United States consumer protection has stalled because of the FDA s 33 year effort to set enforceable guidelines for consumer protection EWG has found a number of serious problems with existing sunscreens including overstated claims about their perfomance and inadequate UVA protection Many of these will be remedied if and when the FDA s proposed sunscreen rule takes effect But even after the rule is enacted gaps will remain FDA does not consider serious toxicity concerns such as hormone disruption when approving new sun filters The new rules would also still allow sunscreen makers to use ingredients like vitamin A that can damage the skin in sunlight and would fail to require makers to measure sunscreen stability despite ample evidence that many products break down quickly in sunlight EWG s Sunscreen Guide was updated with

and a good amount of pressure Totally technical I know Here s what s happening here a lightly buttered and toasted bread b fresh spinach c bright tangy and sweet goat cheese spread The sweetness is a nice compliment to the salty bacon d coffee bacon If you re not excited about this if you re still looking at me with a strange face let me explain Coffee marinated bacon doesn t bake up with a strong coffee flavor The coffee bakes out a bit and lends a depth and richness to the coffee Molasses give the bacon some deep sweetness and chili powder adds some quality kick If you re skeptical I totally get it I just think t hat smashing breakfast items together is cool Give it a try I really do think you ll be surprised I m out in the world being weird with my cookbook White on Rice Couple Cristina

reduce stress or just generally look and feel healthier you ve come to the right place Subscribe to my free weekly newsletter for tips advice and special insider only information Learn more about the Primal Lifestyle by visiting the Primal Blueprint 101 page Thanks for visiting Dear Taco Bell It has come to my attention that you have recently created a Drive Thru Diet You are clearly taking bold new steps to change the way Americans view healthy eating so I am writing this letter to express my gratitude and enthusiasm and to offer insight for further improvement I first noticed your Drive Thru Diet ad on a billboard outside of a childrens extra curricular learning studio in west Los Angeles Ever the inquiring mind I visited Tacobell com for some heavy research I read Christine Dougherty s 80 word story about losing 50 lbs over 2 years with Taco Bell Very convincing Then I watched TV personality Chris Rose interview four paid actors and every single actor praised Taco Bell s seven healthy Fresco menu items Next I learned from registered dietitian Ruth Carey that some food choices are nutritionally better than others These people clearly weren t lying The Drive Thru Diet looked legitimate so I decided to make a Frescolution I hit a road block when attempting to fill out my pledge The form required me to fill out what I know I attempted to write I live a healthy lifestyle based on the 10 immutable Primal laws validated by two million years of human evolution but Taco Bell overrode that with My idea of exercise involves the all you can eat buffet marathon Oh well I suppose what I know isn t nearly as important as eating Taco Bell Fresco menu items So here I am having soaked up the thorough and detailed information on your website almost ready to embark on my two year plan of eating Taco Bell food every day However I have a few simple questions before starting such an exciting healthy journey First I am slightly confused by the math of calorie reduction I understand that a Fresco taco is 20 calories less than a regular taco kudos for that feat of engineering If I am trying to reduce my daily consumption by 500 calories by eating Fresco tacos rather than regular tacos does that mean I need to eat 25 Fresco tacos a day 20 calorie reduction x 25 500 calorie reduction That means I need to eat roughly six tacos a meal including of course fourthmeal Speaking of which I am still trying to work out the logistics of fourthmeal If I eat fourthmeal after midnight is it technically firstmeal In calculating daily calories which day does fourthmeal count for If I eat fourthmeal at the stroke of midnight does it count for both days or neither And also if I eat fourthmeal every day when do I sleep Finally what exactly did Christine eat If I know the combination of Taco Bell choices she made I would feel much more confident moving forward Did she keep a food log Once you have answered my questions I will be delighted to fulfill my Frescolution Additionally while I have no criticism of your company or your dietary philosophy I do see room for improvement in your quest to convert American eaters into healthy decision makers Below I ve listed a few possible menu adjustments 1 A Sans Queso option After close scrutiny of your seven Fresco menu items I discovered the secret to your revolutionary way of creating healthy foods You replace the cheese with tomatoes I m no food lab scientist but with careful engineering it seems you could apply the Cheese Removal Principle to not just seven menu items but to every single product you offer Call it Sans Queso and you ve got an entire menu full of super healthy foods Want a healthy Mexican pizza Sans Qeuso it Sans queso that volcano nachos and you ve turned a 1 000 calorie item into a 920 calorie health food It s not a reduction of quantity it s an upgrade of health You can even charge an extra thirty cents to Sans Queso a food The new anti supersize 2 A calorie total at purchase All your food items have calorie amounts the same as they have prices How hard would it be to include a function on the cash register that adds up the total calories of the foods purchased and prints it on the receipt Heck take it a step further and tell the customer directly Your total is 8 76 and your calorie total is 2 400 Would you like to Sans Queso your meal for an extra thirty cents Bam Satisfied customer more profit and less wasted ingredients Is that genius or what 3 Salsa I m not one to make rude accusations but it does occur to me that you are a Mexican restaurant without a salsa bar I do respect your little border sauce packets of modified food starch autolyzed yeast extract sugar onion juice and xantham gum but including a secondary option of fresh chopped tomatoes onions and tomatillas could improve both taste and the amount of nutrients your customers consume So get yourself a salsa bar People like salsa and they like bars it s a win win 4 An UnFried Salad The traditional Taco Bell Mexican salad sits in an edible bowl of fried enriched bleached flour and corn That fried bowl sits in a second plastic bowl I suggest removing the edible bowl and placing the salad directly into the plastic bowl You may have concerns about the way customers will react to this one bowl concept The problem can be solved easily by using a do not eat this bowl warning label Fill the plastic bowl with a bed of lettuce grilled chicken salsa from your newly installed salsa bar and a couple slices of avocado the fresh kind not the green stuff I ve seen your employees squeeze out of a caulking gun That s a healthy menu item if ever there was one Sans Queso that salad for thirty cents and make it even healthier 5 Water I can t help but notice the 32 oz cup of Diet Pepsi that accompanies all the pictures of your Fresco menu foods Have you considered creating a 32 oz cup that says Water I ve never seen a fast food water cup before Taco Bell could be the first 6 Rename all products according to the Gordita methodology I d never heard of a Gordita before you added one to your menu I had to pull out the old translation dictionary to learn that gordita is Spanish for chubby What a brilliant concept Right there in the name of the food you ve included a warning for how the food will make you look and feel I love it You should rename other menu items to include similar warnings A nacho bell grande could be called an estomago grande a caramel empanada could be a caramel diabetica and a mexican pizza could simply be El Diarrea 7 A weekly taco limit Like the bartender who cuts off the alcoholic set a hard limit on the number of tacos a customer can buy Consult Ruth Carey your registered dietitian and figure out how many tacos a week someone must eat to remain healthy Never sell a customer more than that number Last but certainly not least 8 TELL PEOPLE WHERE YOUR MEAT COMES FROM Consumers are fickle skeptical doubters and I m sure you ve heard some of the rumors and urban legends surrounding the origins of your meat To jog your memory there have been claims that your meat is of lower quality than dog food meat that it contains feces that there are fingernail fragments human blood ash worm copper wire residue cellophane and bits of Jimmy Hoffa floating around in your meat While I m fairly certain these accusations are false I was unable to find any information on your website as to meat origin and quality I even called your hotline with no further success Why not replace one of the 3 giant 5 layer burrito posters on each store using the third to show a picture of the grass fed grass finished cows that I m sure you use to make those burritos I do realize making these changes may take a small upfront investment Because I feel as responsible for America s health as I m sure you do I am willing to put my money where my mouth is If you make all eight of the suggested changes I will donate 10 000 to a charity of your choice perhaps the American Diabetes Association Thank you for reading my letter and for creating a diet that does not require me to leave my car Maybe one day you will take the next step by creating a Delivery Diet so I won t have to leave my house Yours in good health Mark Sisson Get Free Health Tips Recipes and Workouts Delivered to Your Inbox dear taco bell, it has come to my attention that you

life Originally the term detox diet was used in the treatment of people who had become dependent on drugs and alcohol With the growing awareness of alternative medicines for healing the body and the development of various kinds of weight loss diets the term is used for any cleansing diet that helps in detoxifying the body A body Cleansing Diet is done over a short term and involves a change in eating and drinking habits in an attempt to detoxify the body by getting rid of toxins or other contaminants A popular side effect or benefit is weight loss but many people claim an improvement in overall health The most common benefits being increased energy improved immune system and resistance to disease improved mental clarity and better digestion Why do a Detox Diet Few of us have systems that are well balanced because of the lifestyles we live We don t eat healthy food and we dont get enough rest or exercise So our bodies dont function as smoothly as they should We are exposed daily to pollutants and toxins Some from our environment and others are internal toxins produced as the byproduct of our digestive and metabolic processes Toxic and unwanted inorgranic chemicals are found in our foods water and air in the form of fertilizers pesticides heavy metals and other pollutants At home and at work we are exposed to all sorts of airborne micro organisms and debris paint and carpet fumes Everything from plastic containers to dry cleaned clothes to skin and haircare products and cosmetics bombard our bodies with unwanted pollutants All of these fall in the category of environmental toxins Our bodies also produce toxins through normal digestion and metabolism If your body has the proper nutrition in sufficient quantities to provide a healthy biochemistry and if the organs of elimination and detoxification are functioning at optimal levels your body is able to naturally eliminate these toxins safely and efficiently through cellular processes via the main organs of detoxification skin bowels liver kidneys and lungs This manifests as elimination through perspiration bowel elimination urination and respiration However if the body is producing and taking in more toxins than it can safely eliminate a state of chronic toxicity may occur Cleansing diets are designed to help your body rid itself of the toxic matter build up and lose weight If you feel sluggish have frequent colds digestive problems or just arent feeling your best you may have a toxicity issue A detox diet will help you clean the harmful matter from your body and lose weight Choosing a Cleansing Diet Detoxification is a process and can be a gentle cleansing ora more rigorous therapy where many foods are completelyavoided over a long period of time The detoxifying program you would choose would depend for themost part on the condition of your elimination system and yourover all health The good news is that you are not stuck with fasting as the only method of cleansing your body In fact it s now beleived that the liver is unable to cope with a full fast because the pollution of our food and environment is so bad Fasting can release too many toxins into the bloodstream at once so a gentler cleansing program may be a better option It s also more likely that you ll stick to a less stringent detoxification program Master Cleanse Diet Secrets Popular Detoxification Diets include Colon cleansing diets liquid cleansing diets and liver cleanse diets Liver and colon detoxes are growing in popularity as more consumers learn to avoid illness through proper prevention measures such as intestinal cleaning and detoxification In 1985 between 60 and 70 million Americans were affected by digestive disorders Today it s close to 100 million Colorectal cancer one of the most severe digestive or gastro enterological diseases is the second leading cause of cancer deaths Other methods of detoxifying are saunas and baths More Detox Diet Information Make an informed

would taste good pan\u00e9ed that s not the starting point of this recipe Although veal is the more common pan\u00e9ed menu item among restaurants at home I prefer to use pork loin slices or boneless skinless chicken breast meat These other cuts of meat have all the advantages of veal with none of the disadvantages including the dryness expense and the way butchers slice veal wrong which is to say they cut veal way to thick And in most cases store bought veal is really not veal at all but calf and calf is much tougher that true veal Pan\u00e9ed medallions of chicken pork or veal are so easily and quickly cooked that you need to get the pasta or side dish finished before starting this process For any recipe that calls for pan\u00e9ed you need to know that the meats are interchangeable such as the veal with chicken or pork substituting any of the proteins will work in any case Pasta bordelaise is the perfect companion to pan\u00e9ed anything although pasta Alfredo is more common in restaurants In this instance I served a side of steamed spinach and also mushrooms in the style of Mushrooms a la Grecque as you can see in the photos and I will post the recipe for this later Traditionally pan\u00e9ed is a term found among New Orleans restaurants and typically means that the meat portion is cut into very thin slices then lightly dusted with flour dipped into an egg wash and then coated with breadcrumbs and pan saut\u00e9ed in oil or butter until golden brown and cooked through You will find several recipes that call for adding a large quantity of oil to the pan and typically this means about a \u00bd inch or so of oil I find this to be way too much oil You only need enough fat to coat the bottom of the pan and usually this means only a couple of tablespoons olive oil or clarified butter In this recipe I am not cutting the chicken into thin slices just pounding it to about a \u00bd inch thickness Traditional pan\u00e9ed veal or pork would have the meat sliced across the grain to about one eighth to \u00bc inch thickness or less We were taught that when cutting veal for a pan\u00e9e you needed to be able to see through the slice or make it almost paper thin of course this was the challenge and rarely matched Thinner is better In this recipe I have used the Progresso Lemon Pepper Panko Breadcrumbs product and the prize pack information and

essentials: 10 techniques every cook should know"",""body"":""Trained chefs fold fearlessly braise boldly and temper without trepidation These are the sorts of kitchen techniques that shape the pros culinary language Yet these same techniques can panic less practiced cooks many of whom with the economy stumbling are spending more time poring over cookbooks and less time eating out We re here to help Today we re offering a crash course for novices a refresher session for more experienced cooks highlighting 10 essential techniques Mastering these will ease everyday kitchen chores and help you tackle more advanced recipes Deciding which techniques to spotlight generated intense discussion among The Chronicle s Food staff We came up with dozens we thought worthy Some we eventually rejected for being too basic hard cooking an egg for example others missed the cut because we felt they might be too obscure butter poaching fish or too advanced caramelizing sugar In the end we agreed on 10 techniques that for the most part fell into two categories The first covers tricks or methods we consider indispensable ones that appear in recipes over and over dicing an onion efficiently for example breading chicken or meat or making a pan sauce The second category is made up of techniques such as folding or making a roux that might stop someone from attempting a recipe We ve described and illustrated each of the 10 in today s Food section And as a bonus we ve also videotaped each one step by step You can view those videos on sfgate com food then practice what you ve learned with the accompanying recipes Crispy Chicken Salad for example employs three techniques breading segmenting citrus and making a vinaigrette To hone your skills tempering folding and rolling out pie dough try the Coconut Custard Pie Today s 10 techniques are just a starter We ll follow up with future Kitchen Essentials stories on stocking a pantry our favorite tools and appliances and more cooking techniques The 10 today provide a baseline Once you ve mastered these there s always sugar waiting to be caramelized Breading This easy three step technique ensures an even crumb coating It s commonly used on thin cuts of chicken pork or veal that will be fried or baked To begin set up your breading station Fill the first of three shallow dishes with flour In the second dish make an egg wash by whisking eggs with a little bit of water milk or other liquid or seasoning Finally place your breadcrumbs or other crumbs into the third dish Start by dredging a piece of meat in the flour Dredging means to thinly coat the meat with the flour then shake off any excess This eliminates much of the moisture from the surface of the meat and provides something for the egg wash to grab onto The second step is to dip the meat into the egg wash again letting the extra drip off At this point you ll basically have a paste for the crumbs to adhere to Finally press the meat into the crumbs coating evenly Try to work with one hand as you complete the process so as not to bread your fingers on both hands that can lead to a sticky mess Proceed with the recipe as directed Browning Searing Myths abound about the benefits of searing most notably that it seals in the juices In reality searing or browning meat or fish creates a caramelized golden crust that adds texture and a depth of flavor The most important factor in this technique is to start with a very hot pan Ideally you should use one made from a stainless steel or anodized metal a heavy material that will conduct and distribute heat evenly and well Although you can use nonstick pans for delicate fish pans without a nonstick finish do a better job of browning and leave lovely browned flavorful bits to use in a pan sauce see Making pan sauce To brown heat a completely dry pan then add enough oil to lightly coat the surface if you re using meat that has a lot of fat you can skip this step and put it directly into the dry pan The oil should heat to the point where it shimmers but does not smoke You can test this by flicking a droplet of water into the pan if the pan is ready the water should sizzle and evaporate upon contact Place your ingredient directly into the pan It will hiss at first but let it cook until a golden brown crust forms If the pan is heated properly the ingredient won t stick to the pan and you ll be able to lift it with tongs or a spatula easily Keep in mind that if you overcrowd the pan the ingredients will steam rather than brown so sometimes you ll need to cook in batches It s OK to wipe out the pan in between but leave the fond the brown bits that stick to the bottom Dicing an onion If done properly dicing an onion is very simple If you ve never attended culinary school or worked in a restaurant kitchen there s a good chance you ve never learned the proper method It s little more than three basic cuts Before you begin make sure your chef s knife is very sharp so that it slides easily through the onion This will help your watering eyes too Cut off the stem end of the onion trim the root end then halve the onion from top to bottom This will give each half a flat side to place on the board Leave the root end which will be tighter than the stem end intact to hold the onion together peel off the skin and starting with one half face the root end away from you on the cutting board Holding the onion firmly on either side proceed by making vertical cuts along the onion half spacing them according to the desired thickness of the dice You ll want to angle your knife inward at the sides to hold the onion together as you cut along the half Again leave the root end intact and don t cut all the way through to the root Next make horizontal cuts With your knife parallel to the cutting board slice the onion spacing according to your desired dice size and not cutting all the way through the root end Finally cut the onion cross wise releasing the diced onions in each layer as you cut toward the root end When you ve reached the final piece lay it flat on the cutting board and make cuts in both directions to finish the dice This technique can also be used to dice shallots Folding Folding is used in souffles cake batters or any recipe that calls for combining two ingredients of different densities Usually whipped egg whites or whipped cream is incorporated into a heavier batter or custard to lighten the batter In the case of egg whites the air that has been incorporated into the whipped whites acts as leavening to help cakes or souffles rise With the heavier batter in a bowl gently deposit about a quarter of the egg whites or whipped cream on top of the batter Using a rubber spatula gently reach down through the whites and batter to the bottom of the bowl and lift the some of the batter up along the edge of the bowl and over the whites in the center It s all about the twist of the wrist With each folding motion turn the bowl slightly Continue this motion until there are no traces of egg white left Starting with a quarter of the whites or cream will lighten the batter enough so that when you add the remaining egg whites or cream all at once you can easily fold using the same technique Be careful to combine the two ingredients quickly but gently so as not to deflate the air bubbles Making pan sauce One of our all time favorite techniques making a pan sauce is a great secret for home cooks Within minutes you can create a quick professional tasting meal using just a few ingredients This method utilizes the brown bits on the bottom of a pan called fond that appear after you ve used the searing or browning technique with anything from meat or poultry to fish We like to start by sauteing some diced shallots or other aromatics for added flavor either in the fat leftover from browning the meat or in a little extra olive oil or butter Next add liquid to the hot pan and bring to a simmer You can use wine stock vinegar juice or other flavored liquid Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and incorporate it into the sauce adding color and flavor This is called deglazing Reduce the sauce by letting it simmer and cook down which concentrates the flavors and thickens the sauce How long it simmers depends on how much liquid you add but it s never more than a few minutes To finish remove the pan from the heat and whisk in cold cubes of butter which will further thicken the sauce add extra richness and provide luster Season it with salt and pepper and you ll have a finished sauce that will enhance a main course Rolling out pie crust Even the most experienced baker can have trouble rolling out a pie crust and getting it into the pan It s a technique that above all else requires practice Plus outside factors like the temperature of the room or the dough can affect success Start with a flattened round of pie dough that has been chilled in the refrigerator You want it to be cold enough so the butter or fat doesn t melt but malleable enough that you can roll it out somewhat easily with a rolling pin Have a pile of flour on hand for dusting it s imperative to spread it on your work surface sprinkle it on top of the dough and rub some onto the rolling pin to ensure that nothing sticks Starting in the center of the dough make short strokes toward the edges in different directions turning the dough often as it becomes thinner to maintain a circular shape Sprinkle the work surface and dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking avoid adding too much flour which will toughen the dough Stop rolling when the dough is about 2 3 inches larger than your inverted pie pan Place the rolling pin on the edge of the dough that s farthest away from you and roll the dough around the pin toward you until you have about half of it on the pin Gently move the rolling pin over the pie pan and slowly unroll the dough draping and centering it over the pan and gently lift and coax down into the edges Lightly press the dough into the bottom corners of the pan Using a sharp knife trim the excess dough around the outside leaving a 1 2 to 1 inch overhang that you can roll under the border to create a thick edge which gives the crust stability as it bakes Decorate the border as desired either with the tines of a fork or your fingers Making a roux A roux is the traditional way to thicken and enrich gravies sauces and soups It s essential to making our Best Way Gravy that is part of our Thanksgiving section every year and is used often in Cajun Creole cooking A roux is a cooked mixture of equal weights of flour and fat we generally use butter So one stick of butter or four ounces would be blended with four ounces of flour usually a little more than what would fit into a dry half cup measure To make the roux start by melting the butter in a heavy bottom saucepan until it foams and bubbles Add the flour all at once whisking constantly until the two are combined and a smooth consistency has formed It s important to cook the mixture for at least 2 to 3minutes At this point you have a blond or white roux which is used to thicken soups or sauces like bechamel or veloute where the lighter color plays a key role Beyond that the roux will take on different characteristics depending on how long it cooks in the pot Between 5 and 10 minutes the roux will develop a light brown hue and a nutty flavor good for thickening dishes like beef stew In Cajun Creole cooking recipes most often call for a dark brown roux which has been cooked for 20 to 25 minutes Keep in mind that the longer roux cooks the nuttier and richer the flavors become but it will also lose thickening power as it darkens which means you ll have to make more To thicken your dish cook it with the roux mixed in for at least 15 to 20 minutes This will cook out the starchy flour flavor and bring the dish to the desired consistency Segmenting citrus Orange or other citrus segments also known as supremes make a beautiful presentation when they are removed from the peel pith and membrane We love them on salads over fish or in desserts Cut off the top and bottom of the fruit so that it sits flat on the cutting board With a small sharp knife cut away one section of peel and bitter white pith following the natural curve of the fruit from top to bottom Continue around the citrus cutting away sections of the peel and pith as you go Trim any leftover pith once the peel has been removed Holding the fruit in your hand with a bowl underneath make two cuts within the membrane on either side of a segment and with the second cut lift the segment out of the membrane Place the fruit on a plate or in another bowl Continue around the whole fruit in the same fashion The juice will drip into the bowl as you work allowing you to save it for another use such as vinaigrette The peeling portion of this technique can be used for any rounded fruit with a rind such as melons and pineapples Tempering This technique refers to a method that blends ingredients of two different temperatures Most often we use it to incorporate cold eggs into hot liquid such as milk or cream when making custard ice cream or other dishes where eggs are the main thickener In its most basic form tempering involves gradually pouring hot liquid into the eggs in a steady stream while whisking constantly which slowly raises the temperature of the mixture without curdling or scrambling it Once enough of the hot liquid has been incorporated the egg mixture can be poured back into the original liquid where it will begin to thicken the liquid as it continues to cook Note Tempering chocolate is a different process that produces shiny smooth chocolate after melting Making a vinaigrette Knowing how to make a vinaigrette always comes in handy It s something that can be made on a whim with pantry staples and it tastes much better and fresher and is more economical than bottled dressing The basic ratio for vinaigrette is one part vinegar to three parts oil although if you substitute something less acidic like lemon juice for the vinegar you ll want to lessen the oil accordingly As with anything else you ll get the best results if you use the highest quality ingredients You ll need both hands to make a vinaigrette one to pour in the oil and the other to whisk To that end it s important that the bowl sit stationary on the counter If you don t have a rubber bottomed bowl you can shape a towel in a ring around the bottom of the bowl to provide traction Start by dissolving a little bit of salt in the vinegar Though you can season the dressing at the end the salt will dissolve more readily directly in the vinegar Add a small amount of Dijon mustard which acts as an emulsifying agent binding together the oil and vinegar Whisk in the mustard until well combined then slowly pour the oil in a steady stream whisking constantly until the dressing is blended and emulsified If desired you can season with pepper or more salt to taste Experiment with this basic vinaigrette by changing the type of oil or vinegar or by enhancing the dressing with other ingredients like herbs garlic shallots or citrus zest It can be tossed with salad greens or drizzled over grilled vegetables pasta salad fish or meat to finish a dish Crispy Chicken Orange Fennel Salad with

be a Good Football Wife this year Finding it impossible to summon any actual enthusiasm for the game but refusing to fulfill the sitcom wife clich\u00e9 of grumbling about my husband s Sunday afternoon routines in the past I ve mostly tolerated it But with months of cold and or wet Sundays ahead of us I finally came to the realization that football season is the perfect excuse to embrace some much needed Lazy Sundays A morning bagel park and farmer s market run routine segues nicely into an afternoon of bumming around or you know however the person at hand defines it For Alex football with the requisite pre and post game Sports Shouting episodes For Jacob removing books from the bookcases one by one then attempting to stand on them to reach higher shelves so he can remove them too He naps we replace the books he wakes up and starts again Ah Sundays I made a giant pot of beef chili that I found from an old like 20 years Gourmet magazine which like almost all Gourmet recipes I run across makes me sniffle and miss the magazine in its original incarnation that is I haven t made sense of this app thing yet even more Here they gathered all of the things you d normally dollop on top of a bowl of chili cheddar sour cream and pickled jalape\u00f1os and formed them into a biscuit which they use to serve the chili shortcake style I bet you didn t know chili could be so cute I just want to stand up and applaud their creativity but instead I m very sad because I ve been bereft of fresh batches of it for nearly a year I did not cry into this chili however because it was awesome so awesome that the member of our family who a does not know how to use a spoon b wants to eat what you re eating but c refuses to be fed from a spoon actually honored us with the privilege of letting us feed him And tucked away a frightening amount of chili The chili is that tremendous One last thing If you are from Texas I want you to promise to take a deep breath before reading the recipe I know that chili con carne is the official dish of Texas and I know how seriously Texans take their chili con carne and their feelings about things named chili that contain things like kidney beans bell peppers carrots oregano vinegar and if that hasn t blown your top yet tomato sauce too see also Epicurious comments such as No TEXAN would ever call this chili and This recipe is blasphemous Then again if you are from Texas you ve likely got a recipe you were making since you were old enough to stand at a stove and don t need my Chili Con Carne Not Sanctioned By Texans or Those With Texas Allegiances anyway But still I want us all to get along even those of us who shh might like it all blasphemized better One year ago Date Spice LoafTwo years ago Black and White Cookies and Summer s Last Hurrah PanzanellaThree years ago Cream Cheese Noodle Kugel and Spaghetti with Chorizo and AlmondsFour years ago Outrageous Brownies and White Batter Bread A not so new sideblog about feeding babies I have this terrible habit of launching side projects and um not telling people like the six weeks I was blogging at Epicurious or the side blog entirely devoted to cooking Tips Last spring I started sporadically posting some baby food recipes such as applesauce peach sauce with nutmeg a vanilla bean pear sauce and a mango banana sauce There have also been first carrots spinach and white yams Morroccan ish carrots and yams and now we are elbows and eyebrows really deep in finger foods I want to keep expectations real low I m still a one woman operation this site and that little cookbook I m writing are my top priorities right now but obviously with a one year old underfoot a tremendous amount of energy is going into figuring out how to interrupt his steady diet of carpet lint whatever he found on the ground at the park with some occasionally wholesome foods I ll be talking about that over here Beef Chili with Sour Cream and Cheddar BiscuitsAdapted from Gourmet A couple notes First if you like a saucier chili you might reduce the beef by one pound though this might reduce your serving size Second I didn t get the rise out of these biscuits that I d expected to Since they were delicious and other commenters have raved about them I assumed it was me and didn t bother tinkering with them Finally the original recipe says that it serves six but I think it stretches further especially if you re doing this shortcake style with just a ladleful on top I d suggest scaling the biscuit portion to the number of guests you re having If you make more than you need I recommend freezing the extras unbaked until you re ready to serve the chili again you can bake them directly from the freezer and they ll always be fresh and crisp Serves 6 2 large onions chopped about 3 cups 1 4 cup vegetable oil1 tablespoon minced garlic2 carrots sliced thin suggested by Gourmet or in a small dice as I d chop them next time3 pounds boneless beef chuck ground coarse or 3 pounds ground beef1 4 cup chili powder1 tablespoon ground cumin2 tablespoons paprika1 tablespoon crumbled dry oreganoDried red pepper flakes to taste Gourmet suggests 1 tablespoon I used 1 teaspoon knowing that my flakes are very hot 2 8 ounce cans tomato sauce or 2 cups fresh tomato sauce or tomato puree1 1 4 cups beef broth3 tablespoons cider vinegar1 3 4 cups or 1 19 ounce can kidney beans rinsed and drained2 green bell peppers choppedSour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits belowSour cream and pickled jalape\u00f1os optional to finish In a large pot I used a 5 quart and just fit it all heat the oil over moderately low heat and cook the onions in it for 5 to 10 minutes until softened Add the garlic and carrots and cook for one minute more Raise the heat to medium and add the beef stirring and breaking up any lumps until it is no longer pink about 10 minutes Add the chili powder cumin paprika oregano and pepper flakes and cook for another minute Add the tomato sauce broth and vinegar and simmer the chili covered for 35 to 40 minutes if you used ground beef or 50 to 60 minutes if you used coarse chuck Add the kidney beans bell peppers salt I used 2 teaspoons to get the seasoning right for my tastes and pepper to taste and simmer for an additional 15 minutes until the bell peppers are tender Serve ladled over a split Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuit below with additional sour cream and pickled jalapenos if desired Sour Cream and Cheddar BiscuitsAdapted from Gourmet 1 1 2 cups all purpose flour2 teaspoons baking powder1 2 teaspoon baking soda1 2 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into bits1 4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese coarsely grated about 1 1 2 cups Drained and chopped pickled jalape\u00f1os to taste I used about 2 tablespoons 1 cup sour cream Preheat oven to 425 F Whisk together the flour baking powder baking soda and salt in a large bowl Either cut the butter pieces into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or rub them in with your fingertips until well combined Stir in the cheddar jalape\u00f1os and sour cream until the mixture forms a sticky dough Pat it out to a 1 2 inch thickness on a very well floured counter and use a 3 1 2 inch biscuit cutter to cut six rounds Bake on an ungreased or parchment lined if your baking sheets are as weathered as mine are for 15 to 17 minutes until golden on top Do ahead If you d like to serve them over a couple days I recommend freezing already formed but unbaked biscuits until you are ready to bake them you can bake them directly from the freezer adding

Culinary Adventures and Lori of Lipsmacking Goodness Recipes to Rival is a monthly food blogging event conceived in the spirit of The Daring Bakers where the host or hostess chooses a recipe and everyone in the group makes it and posts about the experience at a prearranged date According to Belita s introduction of the recipe Thank George s Bank from The Black Dog Summer on the Vineyard Cookbook is to honor George s Bank a bank on the outer continental shelf of the Gulf of Maine This recipe consists of three parts a fish cake base poached egg and hollandaise sauce We just happened to have grilled some trout for our Fourth of July cookout so I had some leftover fish So while the recipe calls for cod I substituted with trout and it was delicious We will certainly be cooking this recipe again so maybe next time I will use cod as the recipe called for Making this dish presented a couple of firsts for me It was the first time I poached an egg and it was also the first time I made hollandaise sauce I had my doubts at first because the one and only time I had poached egg with hollandaise sauce I didn t like it The sauce was yellow and gross and the egg was tough and rubbery I see now how badly cooked that was Following this recipe with only slight modifications I ended up with something short of sublime The Hollandaise was rich and buttery slightly tangy from the lemon and just a hint of tabasco in the background The hollandaise is in my opinion what carries this whole dish together Since I am scared of raw eggs I used the second version of heating the sauce over a double boiler I thought the amount of butter was a bit much so I reduced it by half about 6 tablespoons The sauce started to get too thick for me so I added more like a couple of tablespoons of hot water rather than just drops I noted the changes I made in brackets on the recipe below Check out how other Recipes to Rival members cooked this dish by visiting the Recipes to Rival Blogroll If you d like to join in the fun visit the Recipes to Rival Forum to learn how The original challenge recipe is now posted here and reposted below with my changes To prepare this dish you will first need to prepare some fishcakes and hollandaise sauce Black Dog Fishcakes this says 4 patties but even with wasting a lot on mistakes I still got 6 I think this more yields 12 I got 6 patties out of this recipe too These fishcakes are a popular Black Dog alternative to bacon or sausage These are excellent for using up leftover potatoes 2 cups cooked potatoes mashed1 pound skinless and boneless codfish I used trout 1 cup diced yellow onion1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme 1 teaspoon dried I used fresh just because I have some 1 teaspoon white pepper1 2 teaspoons salt omitted since the trout was salted and so was the mashed potatoes 1 egg beaten\u00bd cup cream2 tablespoons butter 1 If you don t have leftover mashed potatoes peel and dice two large potatoes Boil in salted water for about 20 minutes or until soft Mash and set aside 2 Place fish in a steamer cover with diced onion and seasonings Cover and steam for 10 15 minutes or until the onion is cooked 3 In a medium bowl combine cooked fish and seasoned onions with the mashed potatoes Mix in the egg and cream divide into four patties 4 Saut\u00e9 the fishcakes in a saut\u00e9 pan in butter over medium heat until browned Easy

Alternately you may use this hollandaise sauce from The Joy of Cooking yields 1 cup for those without a food processor 10 tablespoons 1\u00bc sticks butter 6 Tablespoons 3 large egg yolks1\u00bd tbsp cold water omitted because I missed it when reading the recipe That s probably why I ended up adding more hot water than called for \u00bd 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice I used 2 teaspoons because I tend to like things strongly flavored dash of hot pepper sauce I probably used a good teaspoon salt and white pepper to taste 1 Over low heat melt the butter 2 Skim the foam off the top and keep warm 3 In a double boiler or a bowl on top of a saucepan place the egg yolks and water 4 Off the heat beat the yolks with a whisk until they are light and frothy 5 Place on top of saucepan or double boiler and whisk continuously until eggs are thickened 3 5 minutes making sure the eggs don t get too hot 6 Pour into a separate bowl to cool and while whisking continuously slowly add the butter omitting the milk solids 7 Whisk in the lemon juice hot pepper sauce salt and white pepper 8 If sauce is too thick add a few drops warm water 9 Serve immediately or you can keep it warm up to 30 minutes by

with families are always trying to get dinner on the table as quickly and easily as possible Occasionally we fall back on using prepackaged meals from the grocery store or calling for takeout Those meals have more fat salt and sugar than we need in our diet they produce a lot of garbage from the packaging and they are more expensive than cooking from scratch In these uncertain economic times we really need to look at our food costs and start to spend more wisely Here are seven recipes that will cover your dinners for a week with some leftovers for your lunch They are as quick as takeout as easy as many processed dinners and more economical and nutritious than both Chickpea Curry My son eats a lot of tofu and I m always encouraging him to add more legumes to his diet so I decided on something with chickpeas I had in my mind a recipe from Julie Sahni s cookbook Classic Indian Cooking as a starting point and we made up our own version I had some dried Mexican chilies that Hugh had brought from his store I ve always rehydrated chilies but Hugh put them in the bottom of a dry pan until they were fragrant chopped them finely added a bit of olive oil and then crushed them with a mortar and pestle until they made a paste We had some leftover rice and carrots from the night before and tossed them in as well You could add vegetables such as zucchini or cauliflower as well Get the full Chickpea Curry recipe at Planet Green Beans with Tomatoes and Swiss Chard We actually ended up getting a number of meals from the swiss chard I grew in my garden this summer and I really enjoyed them I had a good handful to harvest and I cooked them up with some fresh tomatoes and mushrooms for a quick throw together meal that was easy and cheap All the measurements are approximate and you can easily put together other legumes such as chickpeas or lentils or other leafy vegetables such as kale or spinach You can eat this as is in a bowl or serve it over pasta or rice If you have any leftovers you can eat it as a cold salad or add some liquid and puree it into a soup The step by step instructions for Beans with Tomatoes and Swiss Chard are over at Planet Green Vegetarian Chili If you feel like a party invite a few friends over and make this easy delicious chili Or better still make it the day before and then you don t have to do anything but heat it up when your guests arrive I looked at lots of recipes for vegetarian chili but in the end I adapted my regular meat based chili because I like the seasonings Without the meat to soak up the heat I found the chili a bit too hot I have reduced the amount of dried chili peppers by quite a bit so if you like your chili on the spicy side you could increase it Use the list of vegetables as a guideline and feel free to toss in whatever you have on hand I used kidney beans but you could add some chickpeas or black beans as well If you do want meat in the chili brown 1 1 2 pounds of ground beef before you add the other ingredients Learn the rest of the tricks for Vegetarian Chili at Planet Green Oriecchietti with Lentils Onion and Spinach I have a confession to make In an attempt to make lentils more palatable for my husband I did something I ve never done before I took a totally healthy vegetarian dish and added bacon Not just any bacon but some magnificent pancetta that my son brought from the store he works in It was just a bit but enough to elevate this dish from nice tasting to really delicious Of course you can always leave the bacon out The full recipe for Oriecchietti with Lentils Onion and Spinach is at Planet Green Dal and Pumpkin Soup I m a big fan of Nigel Slater and his book The Kitchen Diaries A Year in the Kitchen encapsulates his theories about food and cooking I turned to the very front of the book and decided to make his New Year s Day soup Slater apparently has a tradition of making soup on New Year s Day and I heartily approve He calls this a bowl of soup that both whips and kisses It seems like a pretty good meal to have as the weather gets colder and we have the long winter before us All the details for whipping up Dal and Pumpkin Soup are at Planet Green Vegetable Salad Carrots Fennel Radishes Beets and Onion Earlier this year I reviewed Vegetable Harvest by Patricia Wells This lovely winter salad was the first recipe I tried from the book I had just been to the farmers market and bought an enormous bunch of radishes for 50 cents so this recipe seemed fortuitous You could serve this either as part of a family meal or as a first course at a dinner party It is quite colourful and attractive on the plate and is really tasty Whip up a lovely Vegetable Salad Carrots Fennel Radishes Beets and Onion using the recipe at Planet Green Mushroom Tofu Stew Big chunks of meat and potatoes are usually what come to mind when you think about stew But many university students either don t have the money or the inclination to eat that kind of meal I was looking for something that was vegetarian and would be hearty and nourishing while being easy on the pocket book And like all of the recipes in this series you have to be able to make it all in one pot This recipe fulfills all of those requirements but while delicious I will freely admit that it isn t the most beautiful dish I ve ever made Make Mushroom Tofu Stew using the recipe at Planet Green

have been kind enough to let you know which ones to eat After a while though their advice seems to all sound the same and you start hearing the same foods over and over again However there are loads of foods that aren t as popular as some but are just as good or even better Here are 19 of the best yet lesser known foods that are excellent for your health Beets Red juicy and irresistibly sweet beets are reportedly among the 150 healthiest foods on Earth The veggies used most commonly in borscht are incredibly rich in folate and betaine which reduce your risk of developing heart disease by controlling the level of homocysteine in your blood Beets also have high levels of iodine bioflavonoids and Vitamins B1 B2 and C What s more the compounds that give beets their characteristic crimson color betacyanins may have cancer fighting properties While broths and grilled beets are simply delicious to some the best way to eat beets is raw Heating beets usually reduces the amount of antioxidants in them which means canned beets which are often heated during processing are out of the picture too Instead try using fresh beets in salads and other dishes that allow you to eat them raw Cabbage Cabbage gets a bad rap often used in describing awkward smells and ultimately losing out to lettuce as the preferred leafy ball of goodness in most American diets It s a shame though since the vegetable is rich in sulforaphane which enhances the production of certain enzymes that fight free radicals and help prevent cancer In fact research has found that sulforaphane is increases the levels of these enzymes more than all the other plant chemicals It s a great diet food too since a cup of chopped cabbage contains a paltry 22 calories You can pretty much enjoy cabbage as you would lettuce It makes for great Asian style salads and it makes for a great sandwich topping If all else fails you can use it for coleslaw but that would put its low calorie count to waste Canned Pumpkin You might usually see this brought out when mom s getting the Thanksgiving dinner ready but you should ideally see it a lot more often For one thing it s great diet food not only is it low in calories but it s also really filling Canned pumpkin will help you stay clean on the inside too thanks to its high fiber count As if that wasn t enough the orange marvel is rich in Vitamin A which bolsters your immune system Pumpkin is tasty on its own but it s heavenly when combined with spices like cinnamon or nutmeg You can also blend it with a little sour cream for a delicious soup If calories aren t a problem then you can always go with the crowd pleasing favorite pumpkin pie Cinnamon Speaking of cinnamon did you know that this good old dessert spice can actually lower your blood sugar Researchers have found that diabetes patients who consume at least a gram of cinnamon a day on its own not on buns or cakes have their blood sugar levels drop by a significant amount That s because the methylhydroxychalcone polymers found in the spice boost your body s ability to metabolize sugar This also has the extremely beneficial effect of reducing the amount of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in your system As long as it s in your spice rack you can sprinkle cinnamon onto just about anything for and added kick Some foods that go well with the spice are grilled lamb coffee oatmeal and apples Health food stores also often have powerful cinnamon extracts and oils you can use to get its nutritional benefits Dark Meat Dark meat is usually passed over in favor of white meat which has less fat Those who prefer the thighs and drumsticks will be glad to know that dark meat only has 20 calories per ounce more than white meat In addition to that only one third of the fat in dark meat is saturated fat 86 of which doesn t even have a significant effect on your cholesterol levels Even better that same percentage of saturated fat is composed of HDL cholesterol the good kind that might actually lower your chances of developing heart disease Dried Plums Known popularly by their more common name prunes these fruits are usually used in bathroom jokes more than in people s diets What most people don t know is that dried plums are valued for more than just the amount of fiber they pack The and neochlorogenic acids found in them fights off a free radical believe to be a major cause of cancer They re also quite rich in Vitamin K and low in saturated fat sodium and cholesterol The dried fruits make for good snacking on their own If that makes you feel too old though you can always try combining them with roasted or grilled meat They can be used in cakes too Flaxseed What nutrients doesn t flaxseed have Aside from most B vitamins magnesium and manganese they re also rich in omega 3 fatty acids which help fight against heart disease diabetes asthma arthritis and even cancer They also contain lignans which can help prevent breast cancer and type 2 diabetes as well To top it all off flaxseed is high in fiber The trick to getting all these benefits out of flaxseed is to grind it first The nutrients just won t be absorbed into the body unless it s ground After that you can mix it in with your morning cereal for a really healthy breakfast Frozen Blueberries Many people might be surprised to find frozen fruits in this list since freezing has been known to reduce the amount of nutrients in fruits and vegetables However you can t beat the fact that frozen blueberries don t spoil and that they re available year round The tiny fruits are packed with antioxidants manganese Vitamin K and fiber They re also a good low sodium low cholesterol and low saturated fat snack Before you break out the cheesecake remember that blueberries are really tasty on their own to begin with You can also mix them in with yogurt and cereal to add color and flavor Goji Berries Goji berries have long been used as a medicinal food for over 1 700 years in fact They have proportionally the highest antioxidant content of any fruit bringing countless benefits to those who eat them Interestingly enough the sugars found in goji berries might even reduce the risk of developing diabetes Like most berries goji berries are great on their own Their sweet cherry cranberry taste makes them a wonderful treat at any time Fortify your breakfast by mixing them in with your cereal oatmeal or yogurt Guava A lot of folks may not have heard of guavas which are most commonly found in the tropics The fruit contains an abundant amount of Vitamin C the rind alone has more of the stuff than an entire orange It s also got more than 63 potassium than the average banana and a great big deal of fiber You ll also find it a good source of folate manganese and Vitamin A The guava can be enjoyed in its entirety everything from the rind to the seed can be eaten The fruit has a slight tang to it but it gets sweeter the closer you get to the center The tricky part is finding one you ll have a better chance picking up a few at Latin groceries or in high end supermarkets Hemp Seeds While they re usually connected with either new age lifestyle enthusiasts and smokers of questionable substances hemp seeds have a lot to offer the average person For instance they contain a high amount of omega 3 fatty acids which pushes away the risk of heart disease They also contain a lot of protein in the form comparable to meat and eggs The seeds go great in oatmeal or blended together with shakes for an added protein boost They also add a great touch to stir fries Pomegranate Juice Pomegranate juice is very rich in Vitamins C and K potassium and folate It s also been found to help lower the blood pressure of those who drank it regularly While it s been very popular in the Middle East for years the juice can now be found in groceries around the country You can probably find a bottle in a nearby supermarket Since the juice is packed with nutrients a small glassful a day should be more than adequate Pumpkin Seeds While the flesh of the pumpkin is very healthful on its own the seeds are known to have the highest concentration of nutrients in the vegetable The seeds contain oodles on magnesium which is correlated with a reduced risk of early death The seeds are best eaten as a whole An ounce of roasted pumpkin seeds contains roughly 150mg of magnesium making it really easy to reach your RDA of 420mg Purslane While it s considered an herb internationally most Americans classify purslane as a weed This is most likely the reason why many people don t even consider eating this highly nutritious plant Purslane contains the highest levels of omega 3 fatty acids among all fruits and vegetables In addition to this it has the largest amount of the antioxidant melatonin an important antioxidant of any edible plant Purslane can be eaten as a viable substitute for lettuce and is recommended for use in the same way Purslane salads are a favorite among the health conscious Sardines Sardines are more than just fish crammed into a can they re a fantastic source of omega 3 fatty acids calcium iron magnesium potassium and zinc among others They re also rich in protein Vitamin D and a wide range of Vitamin Bs While sardines are good straight out of the can they can also make for pretty tasty ingredients in a wide variety of dishes Pastas are a good way to start before you start experimenting with sandwiches and salads Scallops A lot of people might think that these juicy mollusks are high in cholesterol but that s usually more an effect of the dishes they re in In fact they re very low in saturated fat They ve got an abundance of protein selenium and Vitamin B12 and contain a good amount of potassium and manganese There is a wide variety of dishes that contain scallops so it s relatively easy to find the way you can best enjoy them Pastas soups and seafood dishes are among the most popular ways of serving them Seaweed Whatever variety of seaweed you enjoy you can be sure they re packed with nutrients Besides being low in cholesterol they contain a high amount of Vitamin K calcium iron magnesium and riboflavin among others They re also rich in potassium which can help normalize blood pressure The most well known source of seaweed is in Japanese food but there are other ways to grab a hold of the plant Try looking for dried seaweed in your local supermarket to enjoy it and all its benefits at home Sweet Potatoes This sweet starchy crop is probably one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat They ve got a lot of carotenoids potassium Vitamin C and fiber in them They also contain good amounts of Vitamins A and B6 and manganese You can enjoy them as you do regular potatoes baked french fried chipped and roasted are good ways The main difference is that their sweet flavor allows them to be served in desserts such as in puddings or pastries Swiss Chard This leafy green vegetable may be slightly bitter but their health benefits make for some good eats The carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin in Swiss chard help protect your vision by preventing damage from aging It s also an excellent source of Vitamins A B6 C E and K It s also rich in calcium magnesium potassium and zinc among many other nutrients Swiss chard being both salty and bitter can be a little hard to use in cooking However they re actually

programs are a dime a dozen and it is very important to choose one that suits your current food habits daily routine physical structure and obviously the level of inclination and seriousness Weight Watchers points list is a well researched structure in which points are assigned to every food item In that way you will get a well constructed exhaustive list of food items with their points and the best part is you need not give up your favorite food items Can you believe that Yes it is not at all compulsory for you to delete all the attractive chocolate mousse and cheesy hamburgers from your list Consumption in moderation is the primary keyword of this program and let us find out how Weight Watchers is definitely a constant reminder to those too careless about their body to buck up and see the sunshine I mean it when I say that Weight Watchers is a program which has been adored read worshipped by people for more than 4 decades now It has definitely been successful in helping millions of people out of their stupor and led them to start believing in themselves once again Though the Weight Watchers program has mostly stressed upon the perfect diet it has also included healthy lifestyle changes and exercise regime to lead a healthy stress free life With the advent of 2012 Weight Watchers has unveiled yet another change in their program PointsPlus 2012 which I am sure would do good to those who follow it And the best part is this time they have made changes according to the valuable suggestions of their members which they have been collecting for a whole year It has been now known that PointsPlus program has been widely successful among members and has been beneficial in more ways than one Therefore perfecting the same idea was what members were expecting in the latest program PointsPlus 2012 seems to be more flexible and is personalized This is a great step as we all know that it is impossible to categorize each person and there is absolutely no chance of two people having same physical structure mental health and medical history Therefore it is but obvious that to personalize the program according to each individual will work very well Also the online tools or E Tools free for lifetime members have been enhanced so that members can have easy access to healthy recipes diet charts and plans add their views in the comments column even make changes to the already uploaded recipes and receive help to plan their long term weight loss goals For people starting with the Weight Watchers PointsPlus this year they have put down some very interesting and easy getting started tools Obviously with increase in facilities it is expected that the prices of membership would also increase All in all the new PointsPlus 2012 is working quite well with the members and we just hope it continues to help people manage and maintain their food habits and live healthier lives Food Item Quantity Points Food Item Quantity Points A Abalone 3 oz 2

Ricardo LMHC CIRT Mindfulness Based Approaches Contemplative Approaches Topic Expert Contributor Click here to contact Cindy and or see her GoodTherapy org Profile Facebook Delicious Stumbleupon What do you do when you re feeling anxious depressed or stressed out How do you treat yourself Are you able to be compassionate towards your own emotional pain or do you engage in self criticism judgment or blame For most of us our initial reaction to pain is to look around for someone to blame blame ourselves or ignore our suffering As humans we avoid pain and seek pleasure We either avoid pain by getting distracted taking drugs drinking gambling become workaholics surf the internet etc Or we go to the other extreme reacting towards the world and ourselves through judgment blame or criticism We dwell in reactive thinking I m always doing this wrong or he s always doing it wrong which escalates our emotions Pretty soon we re on an emotional rollercoaster rolling from one emotion to the next and feeling totally out of control Neither of these approaches help us respond to our pain Instead it increases our suffering intensifies painful emotions and keeps us stuck in a pattern of reactive behaviors that lead to feelings of inadequacy and disconnection So why do we engage in behaviors that don t help There are many different reasons behind our reactivity in the face of pain Some of it has to do with childhood experiences and the how we learned to deal not deal with our emotions some of it has to do with our brains and how we re wired to react when danger or a threat is present Stereotypical gender roles for women it s okay to express feelings through sadness and tears for some men the only feeling that is okay to express is anger can greatly influence how we react respond to our emotions Spending time trying to figure out the origin of our triggers is important but it can take a long time and doesn t address the immediate need to alleviate our suffering in the present moment One approach that does help is the practice of Mindfulness Mindfulness a compassionate approach towards life One of the most healing and compassionate approaches to pain that I ve found is the practice of Mindfulness The benefits of this practice are wonderful in that it helps us turn towards our suffering with a desire to heal and stay connected with ourselves the world and others Mindfulness is a practice that helps us stay in the present moment becoming aware of what we re feeling in our bodies our hearts and learning to notice when we re hooked into our stories or reactive thoughts It s a centering and grounding practice so that instead of creating stories getting lost in negative thoughts or reacting towards others out of our defenses we attune to our own pain in a loving way For example in helping others and in developing my own personal mindfulness practice I noticed that when we get triggered feelings of anxiety sadness fear etc can and often do arise When this happens we can be highly influenced by whatever is going on around us From close relationships extended family and friends to the world at large we become like a sponge we soak up everything that s going on in our environment and then move into action trying to resolve fix it or put out fires This is a futile task as there is often little we can do to control what s happening in the outside world and much we can do to transform our reactions into healing responses This isn t an easy task It takes a willingness to explore our reactions become aware of irrational beliefs and learn to accept feelings instead of judging ignoring or trying to change them or blame others for what we re feeling It s only when we re willing to acknowledge and take responsibility for our own feelings understanding our triggers and learning to be compassionate towards ourselves which Thich Nhat Han describes as placing your hand on your heart and saying to yourself I care about my own suffering that we can ride through the pain and find balance in life It takes time and patience to change our conditioned reaction to our emotions and to pain The good news is that we have many opportunities to develop this skill In life we all confront pain at one time or another I strongly believe that developing a mindfulness practice is what helps calm our reactive minds accept feelings and learn to be in the moment Teaching others how to be compassionate accepting and healing towards their own pain is what frees them to experience all that life has to offer Steps Towards Developing a Mindfulness Practice Pause and try one or all of the following Take a slow deep breath As you do become aware of where you feel the breath most distinctly Can you feel the breath as it enters your nostrils do you feel it in your chest or in your abdomen Slowly release the breath and repeat this at least three times or until you feel a noticeable change in your body Become aware of the sensations in your body You don t have to do anything other than notice what you re feeling Do you feel any tingling sensations Any areas of tension stress or pain Just notice any sensations As you notice any areas of tension or stress take a moment to become aware of any thoughts that follow this like feeling a need to do something about it Just acknowledge the thoughts commentaries or judgments about your body sensations for example you might feel pain in your back and then start thinking about how awful your day is going to be because of this pain See if you can tune into the sounds that are going on around you open your eyes and become aware of the colors that surround you the scents and sights Just notice with your senses how much activity is going on around you and take it in Stand up stretch your arms up towards the ceiling while taking in a long breath and then release it slowly You can repeat this three more times and then resume what you were doing Take a few moments to think and write about your experience What was it like to be still for a few minutes Did you notice anything different about your surroundings or about yourself Did you notice how many judgments thoughts commentaries and stories followed your feelings Can you see the benefits of not getting hooked into or following the thoughts and building stories How would this help you be more present to what is going on in the moment What was it like to take a break from your normal routine Whether you are able to dedicate a few minutes a day to restoring balance or whether you engage in one of the above activities I can assure you that doing so will grant many benefits and rewards for both your emotional physical and spiritual well being It s a gift of loving kindness towards yourself Facebook Delicious Stumbleupon

Dap Kings Waitress is a beautiful movie I can t say enough good things about it Without ruining it for you I ll just say it s about a lost woman finding her way back to herself in the face of unforeseen circumstances The very talented and tragically deceased Adrienne Shelly wrote and directed the film She believed that it needed an element of visual interest that would keep an audience focused during an otherwise cerebral story So she decided that the main character should make a lot of pies A pie for every turn in the plot Ultimately Keri Russell s waitress character bakes to cope All that pastry baking contributed heavily to the now cult classic status of the film Well that and the delightfully talented actors Nathan Fillion co stars as a doctor and for those of you who don t know Nathan Fillion is a big time pin up for the lady geek community Like Bruce Campbell before him you could probably put Nathan Fillion in a 27 hour miniseries about the history of car batteries and I d watch with rapt attention It should be noted that my best friend Lindsay told me for years to watch Waitress before I actually did She s like the Movie Whisperer She knows what movie anyone should watch for any reason and she accurately predicted my obsession with both the pies and the Fillion The woman is gifted When I went looking for a recipe to one of the Waitress pies I was pleased to find that not only did the actual DVD sell with ten recipe cards but that just like the Spanglish Sandwich the pies of Waitress inspired bakers everywhere to make their own versions A delightful chocolate crust filled with fresh berries and topped with home made whipped cream I really wanted to try my own hand at Earl Murders Me Because I m Having An Affair Pie I made the pie last night at about 9 30 and right away I know why Keri Russel s desperate waitress character makes it in the throes of guilt This pie could be classified as a medical sedative The rich ingredients mostly butter pure chocolate and heavy whipping cream act the same way that a tranquilizer dart might Roughly five minutes after I served the pie to my husband I looked over to find him snoozing away on the couch dirty plate still in hand Now remember before this pie my only effort for Movie Bites has been a sandwich So to say that the jump in the sophistication level of recipes was a big one is an understatement This one called for ganache I didn t even know what ganache was before yesterday Though I did enjoy dancing around the kitchen singing I made ganache to the tune of The Monster Mash Ganache as it turns out is pure chocolate mixed with boiling hot heavy whipping cream It was the only thing I did right in the whole recipe but boy did it look impressive as I poured the glossy melted chocolate and cream mixture into the finished lumpy malformed crust And as I was almost finished pouring the ganache I remembered the berries I was supposed to mash the fresh blackberries and raspberries into the chocolate crust once it cooled Before I poured in the ganache So I hurriedly poured the berries into the ganache and used a potato masher to try to mix them in and make the whole thing look intentional The resulting pie filling resembled a melted crunch bar But after I topped it all with home made whipped cream For which I bought my first EVER very own hand mixers and some leftover fresh berries the pie looked beautiful Sure it was still boiling lava hot But I served it up anyway I m pretty sure pie isn t supposed to be spooned out like macaroni and cheese But it hardly seemed right to let such a beautiful pie sit in the fridge overnight After moving a thousand miles away from home two weeks ago I ve been consistently blue for the last several nights When the sun goes down for some reason so does my mood But last night baking my ridiculously over the top pie and singing my own version of The Monster Mash well it felt pretty darn good Sure fresh berries are in season It s the perfect time to bake Earl Murders Me pie But my choice may also have had something to do with missing that best friend who introduced me to the wonderful world of Waitress in the first place She may be a thousand miles away right now but the movie she introduced me to became a partial reality in my shiny new kitchen Now that s baking to cope but maybe that s just the chocolate talking Here s the Smith Bites Riff Print This EARL MURDERS ME PIE SHOTS Created by Smith BitesMakes 6 8 Dessert Shots INGREDIENTS 3 4 chocolate biscotti regular size adjust quantity if using minis \u00bd heavy cream 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 tablespoons raspberry vodka 1 pinch salt 4 ounces dark chocolate finely chopped \u00bd cup fresh raspberries \u00bd cup fresh blackberries 1 cup heavy cream 1 3

raspberry vodka and pinch of salt until soft peaks TO ASSEMBLE Spoon 1 tablespoon biscotti into bottom of each shot glass Pour 1 tablespoon chocolate raspberry ganache guh NAHSH on top of biscotti creating the second layer At this point you have two choices a You can place the half filled shot glasses into the refrigerator and let the ganache set up a bit before adding the berry layer OR b proceed and carefully place 1 tablespoon of berries on top of the ganache The final layer will be the whipped cream sprinkled with a few shavings of chocolate This dessert can be made one day ahead

in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Article Summary Bale had to reveal an impressive physique for The Dark Knight Christian only had a few weeks to get the job done before filming This workout will force your muscles to grow lose fat be healthy The Dark Knight Workout It isn t hard to want the life of a celebrity While most of them may have fame and fortune a ripped physique is still not the norm No matter the line of work attaining a lean physique still takes considerable work and mental fortitude I often laugh when I hear people say that the only reason celebrities look great is because they have more money personal trainers and time Well in some cases these things can often spawn a worse physique Having a lot of time and money on your hands can lead to over eating laziness and being complacent We as humans all have the same physiology and therefore can all benefit from the same techniques to attain the leanness we all envy In his upcoming epic movie The Dark Knight Hollywood superstar Christian Bale had to reveal an impressive physique After all he had to fit in a skin tight suit maintain six pack abs and still have a screen presence of being tough Not easy to do Surprisingly though his workouts and nutrition program mirrored that of most of us in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Nutrition The goal of this summers Dark Knight was to have a very lean yet muscular physique similar to the goal of many of us on Bodybuilding com Hence his diet was set up to take advantage of the anabolic window to support muscle growth and limit fat gains To do this most of his carbohydrates were consumed in the morning upon wakening and after his workout Times when glycogen would be at it s lowest and absorption of nutrients would support muscle rather than fat gains His choice of carbohydrates would mostly consist of those that were low on the glycemic index and would therefore keep insulin levels and energy more stable Workouts Christian Bale is known for his ability to transform his physique for various roles For the Machinist he dropped to double digits on the scale In fact many were worried that he wouldn t be able to gain enough weight to play the role of the dark knight Mr Bale not only pulled it off but brought forth a physique that many would be lucky to develop over years of training For anybody to accomplish this they must possess desire and knowledge It s one thing to really want a great body but knowing how is just as important Great Body On A Tight Schedule So he only had a few weeks to get the job done and we can all relate Granted we may not make 20 million dollars for attending our next reunion in ripped shape but at least we can hold our head high and know we truly accomplished something While it isn t advised to cut or gain weight quickly it can be done within reason Many don t advocate this because it is d mn near impossible Dropping weight fast often leads to considerable muscle loss and a scrawny physique Gaining weight fast often leads to little muscle gains and a lot of fat So if we are playing against the odds and trying to get in great shape fast we better be 100 on the money Workout Setup To make significant changes in your physique it helps to have been there before Muscle Memory is one our greatest allies If you were muscular and lean before it is much easier to get there again hence another reason to get in great shape even if it s just once Christian Bale had been there before and knew his body possessed the ability to become lean and muscular The Dark Knights Objective And Goals Attain A Lean Muscular Physique In Less Than 8 weeks Do not sacrifice muscle for weight loss obtain a balance and watch the mirror No cheating on nutrition must be 100 perfect Treat each set and rep like it s our last Each cardio session must be planned and pushed through The Nutrition Plan Consume just enough calories to gain or preserve muscle while still losing fat Keep insulin to an absolute minimum knowing it is most valuable at breakfast and post workout Consume most carbohydrates in the form of green vegetables and low on the GI scale Rolled Oats Ezekiel Bread Green VegetablesProtein must be high at least 1 25 g lbs of bodyweight The Training Plan Train to failure on each set this will activate the most high threshold fibers to initiate growth Favor more volume than intensity as the extra time in the gym will burn more calories Over training is not a major concern we have a movie to make Reps in the 6 12 range with various tactics such as supersets and drop sets Use mostly compound exercises to stimulate the most muscle Train 5 days per week with cardio 7 days per week Workout Setup This will hold true for all workout days Set 1 Setup 4 Sets x 6 8 10 12 Rest 2 Minutes Between Sets The high threshold fast twitch fibers will be activated right away with the heavy weights The higher reps that follow will stimulate other more endurance oriented fibers Wake up the fibers early and reap the rewards later All weights should be chosen accordingly so that the reps listed are able to be performed As an example don t pick a weight you could get 12 reps with for your 4 rep set Also don t forget to warm up thoroughly Set 2 Setup 3 Sets Of 10 12 reps Rest 1 Minute Between Sets Now since we have awoken the giant we will continue to punish you with higher reps and more intensity Now we are going to do 3 sets of 10 12 reps with one minute of rest in between Again pick an appropriate weight For example the first set pick a weight that will allow 12 reps but maybe you could have gotten 14 This way by the third set you will really have to struggle to get 10 Set 3 Setup Two Supersets One Drop Set Rest Just Long Enough To Catch Your Breath And Feel Your Arms Sorry no pain no gain We have a deadline here and you don t want to look good You have to look great Two supersets and one drop set will finish off this body part 30 minutes after each lifting session on a treadmill bike or elliptical This will definitely continue the fat burning as your lifting session will significantly reduce your stored glycogen which makes fat that much easier to tap into Don t forget to consume a fast digesting carbohydrate and protein source after your cardio session to start the rebuilding process Also I highly recommend taking in 10 15 g of BCAA and glutamine in the morning upon awakening and after your weight session to preserve muscle and protect your health The Dark Knight Workouts Monday Chest Triceps Tuesday Biceps Wednesday Quads Hamstrings Thursday Lats MidBack Friday Shoulders Saturday Sunday 30 Minutes Cardio Each Day Nutrition Plan Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 After Workout But Before Cardio Meal 5 Immediately After Cardio Session Meal 6 Bedtime Conclusion There you have it The ultimate guide to your Dark Knight workout Undoubtedly Christian Bale had to train this intensely to transform his body for this summer s most anticipated movie This workout will force your muscles to change and give you just enough protein and carbohydrates to build muscle lose fat and keep you healthy If you can get through six weeks of this and are still

It always seems to get my motor running in the morning and I feel utterly lethargic when I miss out on it The problem is that the mornings are usually chaotic my wife and I are both getting ready for work and also taking care of our son and making sure he s ready for daycare too Soon we re going to add another child to the mix The end result of this is that I had to find ways to have delicious and healthy breakfasts without much effort in the morning I want stuff that s good for me but that I can just yank out and prepare extremely quickly when I need it before I get going Time is of the essence but health and flavor are also important and I also want it to be cheap Are all of these things possible Luckily I m a food nut Here are four recipes for breakfasts that you can largely prepare in advance so that when you re busy in the morning they can be easily prepared Some of them are quite healthy and others are less so but they re all convenient and quick Swiss Breakfast The default recipe for Swiss Breakfast that s what my friend calls it anyway makes about six servings and is as follows 4 cups oats1 teaspoon cinnamon1 2 cup raisins1 2 cup almonds sliced1 2 cup dried apricots chopped1 2 cup sunflower seeds w o shells4 dates chopped1 2 cup dried cranberriesZiploc bags for storage Just mix all of this stuff up together and put it into baggies with about 3 4 cup of the mix in each What I generally do is buy a tub of oats then get proportionate amounts of the rest of the stuff so I can make a ton of baggies Then I bag up the meals and put the baggies back into the oat container which allows me to grab out a baggie whenever I want one This stuff is all dried so the baggies will store for a very long time and be just fine in the cupboard When you pull out a baggie just pour it in a bowl put about a cup and a half of skim milk on top stir it a bit then microwave it for about three minutes on high covered of course This number might vary depending on your microwave and you can also vary the milk to taste I usually slice up some fruit on top but that s not required Banana Bread We love eating bananas but often a few of them will get overly ripe on us and the skin begins to turn dark brown That doesn t mean it s time to throw them out it means it s time for banana bread All you need is a loaf pan 2 cups flour I vastly prefer white flour for this recipe but whole wheat works 1 teaspoon baking soda1 4 teaspoon salt1 2 cup butter considering the amount of butter that s actually in each slice this isn t much 1 cup brown sugar2 eggs beaten4 overripe bananas mashed Use a very tiny amount of the butter to grease down a 9 by 5 bread loaf pan Heat the oven to 350 F Mix together the butter and brown sugar a mixer works well for this on low then add eggs and mashed bananas until it s all gooey and consistent Add the rest of the ingredients then stir just a bit more until it s largely consistent Pour the mix in the pan stick it in the oven for about an hour and you re good The ol toothpick test works to see if it s done slide in a toothpick in the middle and if it comes out clean and smooth you re good Take it out slice off some slices and put the rest in a big Ziploc bag in the freezer I usually pull out the loaf in the evening from the freezer then slice pieces in the morning for breakfast I like it plain some put butter on it and warm it up Then just pop it back in the freezer Breakfast Burritos A while back I mentioned a early less healthy form of this recipe Here s what I m currently using 2 pounds of cured smoked sausage cubed or 2 pounds of soyrizo the last batch I did was a pound of each 4 medium onions diced2 bell peppers diced2 tomatoes diced2 pounds of shredded cheese fat free cheese works just fine for this or you can skip it 16 eggs32 big flour tortillas 10 ones work well 1 jar of picante sauceSaran wrap or Ziploc freezer bags for packing Cut up the meat and vegetables and split it into four separate equal batches Crack all sixteen eggs blend them so the yolk is even then separate this into four equal batches Saute a batch of meat and veggies for about ten minutes if you re using soyrizo you may want to cook it just a bit first before the veggies then add a batch of the eggs and stir regularly until the eggs are cooked Each small batch here makes eight burritos so spoon some of the egg veggie meat mix onto a tortilla shell put some cheese and a bit of picante sauce on top then fold it up and wrap it in Saran wrap Toss the finished burritos in the freezer I can make 32 burritos in about an hour and a half following this process When you pull out a burrito unwrap it put it on a saucer and microwave it for about two minutes from frozen Cherry Muffins One fun Sunday activity is making muffins The only tools you ll need are some paper muffin cups a muffin pan a bowl and a spoon Oh yes and food 1 1 2 cups flour white or whole wheat whatever you prefer 1 cup rolled oats3 1 2 teaspoons baking powder1 2 teaspoon baking soda1 4 teaspoon salt1 cup light brown sugar2 eggs6 tablespoons butter1 1 2 teaspoons vanilla3 4 cup buttermilk low fat is fine here 1 1 2 cups coarsely chopped cherries frozen or fresh about 8 ounces Saran wrap for packing Melt the butter Mix the eggs until consistent and add the vanilla and butter to the eggs and mix Mix together all of the dry ingredients besides the cherries in a bowl Mix in all of the moist ingredients into the dry ones besides the cherries until it s consistent Mix in the cherries Put muffin cups in your pan then pour in batter until it s just below the top of the cup Heat oven to 375 F and bake for about 22 minutes To make sure they re done press the top of the muffin and see if it feels like a muffin springs back a bit when pushed down not gooey at all but moist Then wrap them individually in Saran wrap and toss the ones you won t eat in the next day or two in the freezer If you want to enjoy a muffin or two for breakfast just pull it out of the freezer the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight You might also want to microwave it just a bit if you like warm muffins In short breakfast can be convenient tasty healthy and inexpensive if you re willing to put in just a bit of effort in your spare time helping you succeed at what you care about. personal finance, money, debt, credit cards,

stuff every time it s offered to me When I was younger I used to get really nauseous whenever I thought about eggnog Something about its texture and thick nature made me gag It probably didn t help that the only people I saw drinking eggnog were my annoying teachers who thought wearing ugly Christmas sweaters to school was really cool These teachers also didn t seem to understand that wearing socks with Birkenstocks was rather tragic and pointless and that deodorant is a necessity not just a privilege I guess you can understand why I avoided eggnog like the plague But after reading the recipe for Flo Baker s Eggnog Poundcake I decided to toss my nog bias out the window and try it out And man am I glad that I did because this cake totally rocked my world Who knew that eggnog could work as such a fantastic baking ingredient Well I guess others have found out about its hidden talent but I am here to join the bandwagon Don t know what eggnog is Yes me either That s why I am so grateful for the folks at Cookthink for properly schooling me about this delicious seasonal treat A blend of eggs sugar cream and liquor it practically screams BAKE ME While this cake takes a little time to put together it is completely worth it Putting the cake together isn t a tedious process especially when you compare it to making \u00e9clairs or something but it dirties a lot of pans and makes for big cleanup patrol But the minute the cake appears out of your oven you won t care Actually the minute the cake s scent fills your kitchen you will forget all about the flour and sugar on your kitchen floor or the screaming children in the other room or the annoying roommate clanking away All your sense will be glued to the cake in the oven Consider it a moment of zen And don t forget about the rum Ah yes R U M Who knew three letters could evoke such warm feelings While you can t make out the rum flavor in the actual cake it definitely makes its presence known As you bite into the soft cake you will be wondering What IS that And then proceed to eat more and more Instead of making one big cake I used some foil loaf pans so I could gift wrap these cakes and send them on their merry ways to loved ones Pound cakes are notorious for standing the test of time and in fact they get better with each passing day On the second or third day the cake becomes more dense and moist but not heavy The crumbs tighten and soften at the same time Am I making any sense It s hard explaining baking magic All I know is that I could barely resist these little loaves after a couple of days Good thing I gift wrapped my big loaf cake or else it would ve been devoured in between paper presentations I didn t make the crystal rum glaze because shipping the cakes with the glaze would be all bad but I can only imagine how yummy the cake would be with just a drizzle of this hot sugary rum glaze While I still can t stomach it on my own the mere idea of an Eggnog latte from Starbucks makes my stomach churn I will use it much more frequently in baked goods especially around this time of the year I m thinking about making eggnog cupcakes or an eggnog cheesecake The possibilities are

per serving Prep Time 20 minutesCooking Time 55 to 65 minutesInactive Prep Time 10 minutes Ingredients 1 2 cup dried currants 2 tbsp dark rum or water 3 cups all purpose flour 2 tsp baking powder 1 4 tsp salt 1 4 tsp nutmeg preferably freshly grated 8 oz unsalted butter at room temperature 2 cups 14 ounces granulated sugar 3 large eggs lightly beaten 1 cup 8 fluid ounces store bought refrigerated rather than canned eggnog 1 tsp pure vanilla extract For the crystal rum glaze 3 4 cup 5 1 4 ounces granulated sugar 2 tbsp dark rum 2 tbsp water Directions 1 In a small bowl combine the currants and rum and set aside to macerate for 15 minutes Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 F 175 C or 325 F 160 C if the pan has a dark finish Butter a 10 by 3 inch Bundt pan lightly coat it with nonstick spray then flour it tapping out the excess flour Or butter and flour a 10 by 4 1 4 inch tube pan with or without a removable bottom If the pan has an intricate design or detail I take extra precaution spreading it first with solid vegetable shortening followed by a coating of nonstick spray and then a dusting of flour to ensure the finished cake releases in one piece Have all of the ingredients at room temperature 2 Sift together the flour baking powder salt and nutmeg onto a sheet of waxed paper set aside Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter on medium low speed until creamy and smooth 30 to 45 seconds Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl Add the sugar in a steady stream and continue to beat on medium speed until light in color and fluffy about 5 minutes stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl 3 With the mixer still on medium speed add the eggs 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time beating after each addition until incorporated and stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl On the lowest speed add the flour mixture in four additions alternately with the eggnog in three additions beginning and ending with the flour mixture and mixing after each addition until incorporated Stop the mixer as needed to scrape down the sides of the bowl Add the vanilla during the final moments of mixing 4 Detach the paddle and bowl from the mixer and tap the paddle against the side of the bowl to free the excess batter Using a rubber spatula gently fold in the currants and any remaining rum Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly with the spatula 5 Bake the cake just until the top springs back when lightly touched in the center and the sides are beginning to come away from the pan 55 to 65 minutes Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in the pan for about 10 minutes while you prepare the glaze Make the crystal rum glaze 1 In a small bowl combine the sugar rum and water and stir with a rubber spatula just until blended 2 Without delay tilt and rotate the cake pan while gently tapping it on a counter to release the cake sides Invert a wire rack on top of the cake invert the cake onto it and carefully lift off the pan Slide a sheet of waxed paper under the rack to catch any drips from the glaze Using a pastry brush coat the top and sides of the warm cake with all of the glaze Let the cake cool completely before serving 3 To serve slide the base of a tart pan a small rimless baking sheet or a large offset spatula under the cake and carefully

they do the more evidence Ohio State University scientists find that specific elements of marijuana can be good for the aging brain by reducing inflammation there and possibly even stimulating the formation of new brain cells The research suggests that the development of a legal drug that contains certain properties similar to those in marijuana might help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer s disease Though the exact cause of Alzheimer s remains unknown chronic inflammation in the brain is believed to contribute to memory impairment Gary WenkAny new drug s properties would resemble those of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the main psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant but would not share its high producing effects THC joins nicotine alcohol and caffeine as agents that in moderation have shown some protection against inflammation in the brain that might translate to better memory late in life It s not that everything immoral is good for the brain It s just that there are some substances that millions of people for thousands of years have used in billions of doses and we re noticing there s a little signal above all the noise said Gary Wenk professor of psychology at Ohio State and principal investigator on the research Wenk s work has already shown that a THC like synthetic drug can improve memory in animals Now his team is trying to find out exactly how it works in the brain The most recent research on rats indicates that at least three receptors in the brain are activated by the synthetic drug which is similar to marijuana These receptors are proteins within the brain s endocannabinoid system which is involved in memory as well as physiological processes associated with appetite mood and pain response This research is also showing that receptors in this system can influence brain inflammation and the production of new neurons or brain cells When we re young we reproduce neurons and our memory works fine When we age the process slows down so we have a decrease in new cell formation in normal aging You need those cells to come back and help form new memories and we found that this THC like agent can influence creation of those cells said Yannick Marchalant a study coauthor and research assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family We re not saying that but it might actually work What we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging So that s really hopeful Wenk said Marchalant described the research in a poster presentation Wednesday 11 19 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington D C Knowing exactly how any of these compounds work in the brain can make it easier for drug designers to target specific systems with agents that will offer the most effective anti aging benefits said Wenk who is also a professor of neuroscience and molecular virology immunology and medical genetics Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family We re not saying that but it might actually work What we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging So that s really hopeful Wenk said One thing is clear from the studies Once memory impairment is evident the treatment is not effective Reducing inflammation and preserving or generating neurons must occur before the memory loss is obvious Wenk said Marchalant led a study on old rats using the synthetic drug called WIN 55212 2 WIN which is not used in humans because of its high potency to induce psychoactive effects The researchers used a pump under the skin to give the rats a constant dose of WIN for three weeks a dose low enough to induce no psychoactive effects on the animals A control group of rats received no intervention In follow up memory tests in which rats were placed in a small swimming pool to determine how well they use visual cues to find a platform hidden under the surface of the water the treated rats did better than the control rats in learning and remembering how to find the hidden platform Old rats are not very good at that task They can learn but it takes them more time to find the platform When we gave them the drug it made them a little better at that task Marchalant said In some rats Marchalant combined the WIN with compounds that are known to block specific receptors which then offers hints at which receptors WIN is activating The results indicated the WIN lowered the rats brain inflammation in the hippocampus by acting on what is called the TRPV1 receptor The hippocampus is responsible for short term memory With the same intervention technique the researchers also determined that WIN acts on receptors known as CB1 and CB2 leading to the generation of new brain cells a process known as neurogenesis Those results led the scientists to speculate that the combination of lowered inflammation and neurogenesis is the reason the rats memory improved after treatment with WIN The researchers are continuing to study the endocannabinoid system s role in regulating inflammation and neuron development They are trying to zero in on the receptors that must be activated to produce the most benefits from any newly developed drug What they already know is THC alone isn t the answer The end goal is not to recommend the use of THC in humans to reduce Alzheimer s Marchalant said We need to find exactly which receptors are most crucial and ideally lead to the development of drugs that

do with DNS or the the web or TCP IP In fact this project has nothing to do with security at all Instead I ve been working on correcting color blindness Check it out These are the Ishihara test plates You might be familiar with them If you can read the numbers on the left you re not color blind You can almost certainly read the numbers on the right That s because DanKam has changed the colors into something that s easier for normal viewers to read but actually possible for the color blind to read as well The goggles they do something Welcome to DanKam a 3 app being released today on iPhone and Android ISSUES WITH CHECKOUT RESOLVED THIS CODE IS LIVE DanKam is an augmented reality application designed to one of several unique and configurable filters to images and video such that colors and differences between colors are more visible to the color blind EDIT Some reviews Wow Wow waxpancake Dan Kaminsky made an augmented reality iPhone app for the colorblind And it works Oh and I used it today in the real world It was amazing I was at Target with my girlfriend and saw a blue plaid shirt that I liked She asked me what color it was so I pulled up DanKam and said purple I actually could see the real color through my iPhone Thanks so much I know I ve said it 100x already but I can t say it another 100x and feel like I ve said it enough Really amazing job you did Blake Norwood I went to a website that had about 6 of those charts and screamed the number off every one of those discs I was at work so it was a little awkward JJ Balla Reddit Thank you so much for this app It s like an early Christmas present I too am a color blind Designer Webmaster type with long ago dashed pilot dreams I saw the story on Boing Boing and immediately downloaded the app My rods and cones are high fiving each other I ran into the other room to show a fellow designer who just happened to be wearing the same I heart Color t shirt that you wore for the Forbes photo How coincidental was that Anyway THANKS for the vision Major kudos to you Patrick Gerrity Just found this on BoingBoing fired up iTunes installed and tried it Perfectly done That will save me a lot of trouble with those goddamn multicolor LEDs Blinking green means this flashing red means that Being color blind it is all the same But now having DanKam in my pocket I have a secret weapon and might become the master of my gadgetry again Can t thank you enough klapskalli Holy shit It works It WORKS Not perfectly for my eyes but still it works pretty damned well I need a version of this filter I can install on my monitors and laptop asap And my tv Wow That is so cool Thanks for sharing this Wish I could favorite it 1000 more times zarq on Metafilter As a colorblind person I just downloaded this app How can I f cking nominate you to the Nobel Prize committee I am literally almost in tears writing this I CAN FRICKIN SEE PROPER COLORS PLEASE KEEP UP THIS WORK AND CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS APP Aaron Smith At this point you re probably asking Why is some hacker working on vision How could this possibly work Well why has a fairly epic answer So we re in Taiwan building something amusing when we go out to see the Star Trek movie Afterwords one of the engineers mentions he s color blind I say to him these fateful words What did you think about the green girl He responds with shock There was a green girl I thought she was just tan Lulz But I was not yet done with him See before I got into security I was a total graphics nerd See The Imagery archive on this website Graphics nerds know about things like colorspaces Your monitor projects RGB Red Green Blue Printouts reflect CYMK Cyan Yellow Magenta blacK And then there s the very nice colorspace YUV Black vs White Orange vs Blue and Red vs Green YUV is actually how signals are sent back to the brain through the optic nerve More importantly YUV theoretically channelizes the precise area in which the color blind are deficient Red vs Green Supposedly especially according to web sites that purport to simulate color blindness for online content simply setting the Red vs Green channel to a flat 50 grey would simulate nicely the effects of color blindness Alas H L Mencken For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong My color blind friend took one look at the above simulation and said Heh that s not right Everything s muddy And the jacket s no longer red A color blind person telling me about red That would be like a deaf person describing the finer points of a violin vs a cello I was flabbergasted a word not said nearly enough I ll have you know Ah well As I keep telling myself I love being wrong It means the world is more interesting than I thought it was There s actually a lot of color blind people about 10 of the population And they aren t all guys either about 20 of the color blind are female it totally runs in families too as I discovered during testing But most color blind people are neither monochromats seeing everything in black and white or dichromats seeing only the difference between orange and blue No the vast majority of color blind people are in fact what are known as anomalous trichromats They still have three photoreceptors but the green receptor is shifted a bit towards red The effect is subtle Certain reds might look like they were green and certain greens might look like they were red Thus the question Was it possible to convert all reds to a one true red and all greens to a one true green The answer Yes given an appropriate colorspace HSV for Hue Saturation Value is fairly obscure It basically refers to a pattern of computing a true color the hue the relative proportion of that color to every other color saturation and the overall difference from darkness for the color value I started running experiments where I d leave Saturation and Value alone and merely quantize Hue This actually worked well see the image at the top of the post DanKam actually has quite a few features here s some tips for getting the most out of it Suppose you re in a dark environment or even one with tinted lights You ll notice a major tint to what s coming in on the camera this is not the fault of DanKam it s just something your eyes are filtering There are two fixes The golden fix is to create your own white balanced Light But the other fix is to try to fix the white Balance in software Depending on the environment either can work Use Source to see the Ishihara plates to validate that the code works for you or to turn on Color Wheel to see how the filters actually work Feel free to move the slider left and right to tweak the values for your own personal eyeballs There are multiple filters try em HueWindow is sort of the brute forcer it ll only show you one color at a time Size matters in color blindness so feel free to put the phone near something pause it and then bring the phone close Also double clicking anywhere on the screen will zoom The gear in the upper left hand corner is the Advanced gear It allows all sorts of internal variables to be tweaked and optimized They allowed at least one female blue green color blind person to see correctly for the first time in her life so these are special In terms of use cases matching clothes correctly parsing status lights on gadgets and managing parking structures are all possibilities In the long run helping pilots and truckers and even SCADA engineers might be nice There s a lot of systems with warning lights and they aren t always obvious to the color blind Really though not being color blind I really can t imagine how this technology will be used I m pretty sure it won t be used to break the Internet though and for once that s fine by me Ultimately why do I think DanKam is working The basic theory runs as so The visual system is trying to assign one of a small number of hues to every surface Color blindness as a shift from the green receptor towards red is confusing this assignment It is possible to emit a cleaner signal such that even colorblind viewers can see colors and the differences between colors accurately It has nothing to do with DNS I kid I kid But no really Nothing If there s interest I ll write up another post containing some unexpected evidence for the above theory "",""url"":""dankaminsky 2010 12 15

University created a spider bot just four nanometres across This is about 100 000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair Credit Courtesy of Paul Michelotti A team of scientists from Columbia University Arizona State University the University of Michigan and the California Institute of Technology Caltech have programmed an autonomous molecular robot made out of DNA to start move turn and stop while following a DNA track The development could ultimately lead to molecular systems that might one day be used for medical therapeutic devices and molecular scale reconfigurable robots robots made of many simple units that can reposition or even rebuild themselves to accomplish different tasks The nano spider moves along a track comprising stitched together strands of DNA that is essentially a pre programmed course The track exploits DNA s double helix molecule a structure of four chemicals that are paired in rungs By unzipping the DNA you end up with a track that can be used rather like the teeth in a clockwork mechanism A cog can move around the teeth provided it meshes with them By using strands that correspond to sequences in the track the robot can be made to walk turn left or right as it is biochemically attracted to the next matching stretch The spider s body is a common protein called streptavidin Attached to it are three legs of single strand enzymatic DNA which binds to and then cuts a particular sequence of DNA The fourth leg is a strand that anchors the spider to the starting point Milan N Stojanovic a faculty member in the Division of Experimental Therapeutics at Columbia University led the project and teamed up with Winfree and Hao Yan professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Arizona State University and an expert in DNA nanotechnology and with Nils G Walter professor of chemistry and director of the Single Molecule Analysis in Real Time SMART Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for what became a modern day self assembly of like minded scientists with the complementary areas of expertise needed to tackle a tough problem Study leader Milan Stojanovic told that after the robot is released from its start site by a trigger strand it follows the track by binding to and then cutting the DNA strands Once the strand is cut the leg starts reaching for the next matching stretch of DNA in the track In this way the spider is guided down the path set by the researchers The latest installment in DNA nanotechnology has arrived A molecular nanorobot dubbed a spider and labeled with green dyes traverses a substrate track built upon a DNA origami scaffold Credit Courtesy of Paul Michelotti Eventually the robot encounters a patch of DNA to which it can bind but cannot cut At that point it is immobilised To watch the spider in motion the researchers used atomic force microscopy which showed the molecular robots following four different paths Molecular robots have drawn huge interest because of the allure of programming them to sense their environment and react to it For instance they could note disease markers on a cell surface decide that the cell is cancerous and needs to be destroyed and then deliver a compound to kill it Other DNA walkers have been developed in the past but they have never ventured more than a few steps Although other DNA walkers have been developed before they ve never ventured farther than about three steps said Hao Yan a professor at Arizona State University This one says Yan can walk up to about 100 nanometers That s roughly 50 steps This in itself wasn t a surprise adds Winfree since Milan s original work suggested that spiders can take hundreds if not thousands of processive steps What s exciting here is that not only can we directly confirm the spiders multistep movement but we can direct the spiders to follow a specific path and they do it all by themselves autonomously The next step is how to make the spider walk faster and how to make it more programmable so that it can follow many commands on the track and make more decisions In a separate study reported in Nature Nadrian Seeman and colleagues from New York University said they had built a prototype molecular factory They used a number of DNA robots to assemble gold particles in different ways in response to chemical commands DNA walkers moved past three kinds of DNA machines that handed them a cargo of gold nano particles which are clutched with three hands This is the first time that systems of nano machines rather than individual devices have been used to perform operations constituting a crucial advance in the evolution of DNA technology said Lloyd Smith from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in a commentary also published by Nature Nearly 6 billion is being invested in research and development of nano products worldwide according to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies which tracks environmental and health concerns arising from the new technology via DailyMail UK and EurekAlert a team of scientists from columbia university, arizona state university, the university of michigan, and the california institute of technology (caltech) have programmed an autonomous molecular robot made out of dna to start, move, turn, and stop while following a dna track. dna nano-spiders,dna robots,dna to start,independent walking robots,independent walking robots made of

experienced demolitions expert blows the cover on 9\/11 inside job."",""body"":""Meet Torin Wolf He has a broad and varied background as a US Army Combat Nurse during Operation Iraqi Freedom building construction contractor certified structural welder certified asbestos and hazardous materials worker experienced demolitions expert teacher radio show host and well studied 9 11 truth activist Torin knows how to put a building up and bring the same building down in its own footprint Torin s free presentation Taking the Red Pill was hosted by Brave New Books on 1904 Guadalupe in Austin last Saturday June 23rd at 7 pm Torin is proud of his native Cherokee heritage and his mother is the Band Historian of the White River Band Cherokee from the central United States Since he received his GED at age 14 saying he is a smart guy is putting it lightly For over 12 years he worked as a hazardous materials contractor specializing in asbestos abatement and concrete construction sampling Add to his resume the fact that he designed and implemented well over 100 controlled demolitions He was not just helping at a lower level in the demolitions he was the guy responsible for calling the shots Afterwards he became a certified structural steel welder and worked in heavy and mega construction for over 5 years in locations around the world including several skyscrapers Ironically Torin signed his papers to join the army on September 11th 2000 He knew something was wrong with the official 9 11 story when his army handlers took his squad into a room just in time to watch the buildings collapse With his demolitions experience he immediately knew those towers could not have fallen like that without explosives He went on to serve with honor and distinction with the 21st Combat Support Hospital in Mosul Iraq during the first part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and earned the Bronze Star with V device for valor in combat While saving over 120 lives Torin earned the Combat Medical Badge by providing medical care to US allied enemy soldiers and civilians under combat conditions Torin s arms display Samoan life saving tattoos each line and symbol representing a group of lives saved The army would like you to think he wasn t in Iraq but unfortunately for them Torin appears in a recent documentary filmed there A true hero helping save lives in the middle east Torin can be seen in section 4 of a PBS documentary called Life and Death in the War Zone With Torins impressive list of qualifications his unwavering voice holds a power that shatters the lies of 9 11 sold to us by the government and mainstream media The official story we ve been told about 9 11 is absolutely physically impossible Those words are not just backed up with his qualifications because his presentation goes through the hard physics as well The presentation starts out with a serious warning that reminds us the state our country is in after the false flag attack and ensuing tyrannical hijacking of the government on that September morning A hijacking not by Bin Laden not by Al Qeada but by a group of tyrants that orchestrated and benefited from 9 11 Unless you want to be charged as a terrorist I suggest you leave the room now This is technically seditious material and you can be charged under section 802 of the Patriot Act just for being here This upsets a few people near the front row Everyone looks around to see if that will scare anyone off but luckily no one leaves and the presentation continues The bookstore is now filled with former American citizens now terrorists simply because they want to learn the truth of what happened on 9 11 If you think the patriot act only applies to foreigners or dehumanized muslims with brown skin you are very wrong Torin rubs the effect in even more We American citizens don t even have to be charged foreigners do Then tells us that the patriot act was written prior to 9 11 This is admitted Also admitted is the fact that the patriot act has been used to come after American citizens over eight hundred times The presentation moves on and goes through some of the just plain crazy theories of why the towers fell such as space beams holograms missiles orbs pterodactyls etc and easily debunks them Torin then adds There is evidence most of these are put out by the government as disinfo Then explains how the White House in violation of the law has bought 28 billion Billion with a B in fake news But the craziest most truly unhinged conspiracy theory for the towers falling on 9 11 Torin asks rhetorically Fire The official story cannot be recreated by any experiment NIST is the government agency involved in attempting to model what happened to the world trade center on 9 11 and they fail horribly NIST never models what happens after the collapse initiation and even what they do model before that is easily debunked NIST created 16 separate physics programs to simulate the WTC 1 2 collapses and only got 1 to collapse partially Torin adds When they did in the computer model they removed 40 of the structural support The cross trusses that the towers received a significant amount of their strength from had to be removed to have a collapse in the computer simulation Torin then mocks the official story There s no such thing as a pancake collapse but there is a progressive collapse A few slides are shown of progressive collapses throughout the world None of them are anything like what happened to the world trade center with its pulverized concrete 100 microns or smaller just seconds after the start of collapse and then its complete destruction Torin uses his expertise to explain to the audience how and why a real progressive collapse occurs and subsequently why the WTC was not a progressive collapse The biggest problem with the argument Torin explains Time Several slides are then presented that show the hard physics and observed time of WTC 2 falling Worst case scenario would require 0 5 seconds per floor for collapse The absolute minimum amount of time for a progressive collapse would be 43 seconds How long did it take for the building to fall in reality About 8 6 Seconds For the towers to fall at so close to free fall speed over 110 000 separate and independent structural support points had to fail simultaneously Pancake theory does NOT explain the failure of the cores Torin explains passionately obviously upset with the lies being told to the American people Nothing is holding the building up No resistance 110 000 structural failures at the same time Torin Nothing is holding the building up No resistance 110 000 structural failures at the same time Next we are shown an incredible bit of detective work on Torins part He shows a sequence of 12 different pictures of the collapse initiation of the North tower WTC 1 Torin explains that the antenna on the top of the world trade center is a perfect guide of measurement for height as there is a standard of changing the paint color of antennas once per fifty feet The part of the antenna on the roof of WTC 1 appears black then white alternated every fifty feet There is a guide wire in the bottom left of every picture that shows that the camera does not move Why is this picture so interesting It shows the antenna which is held up by the core columns fall before the rest of the building while the fire line on the 78th floor doesn t move Torin then goes through the hard physics of the scene we re looking at and explains how it directly contradicts the official story This building is not collapsing on the 78th floor The antenna falls 56 feet before the 78th floor falls Torin then gives his expert analysis on building 7 for about five minutes For those that are new to this information building 7 was the third building to collapse on 9 11 After a thirty second countdown was given by firefighters it collapsed perfectly into its own footprint at 5 20 in the afternoon It housed the IRS Department of Defense CIA Secret Service and the Security and Exchange Commission among many others While I can t cover all of the hard hitting information Torin brought up about building 7 the highlight was his analysis of the collapse which played over and over again on the screen behind him There is no doubt about it this is a controlled demolition profile then Torin directed everyone to view the kink which is characteristic of a controlled demolition Dangerously high levels of asbestos lead PCBs mercury radioactive materials and powdered concrete were in the air after the towers were demolished Much to the surprise of many audience members we learned from Torin that by far the most dangerous on the list was the pulverized concrete The pulverized concrete which was thick in the air around ground zero after the collapses of WTC 1 and 2 had a pH of 12 which is about the same as drain cleaner This pH level when breathed in and gets wet in your lungs will cause chemical burns Wet concrete can burn you Torin adds The asbestos is bad but that will kill you over 20 years the powdered concrete will kill much faster So its no surprise to learn that all of the 9 11 rescue and recovery dogs are dead Torins report goes on to explain how emissions from the WTC piles were recorded to be hundreds of times above the legal Permissible Exposure Limit as established by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health for more than 2 weeks after 9 11 Sheer contempt of Christine Todd Whitman head of the EPA is expressed next by Torin Torin is rightly angry at her for saying the air was safe to breathe and that people should return to work even though they refused to release the data from their testing at that time to substantiate their declaration Torin uncovers that The EPA didnt begin monitoring for airborne asbestos levels until 8 00pm September 14 2001 a day and a half after they told everyone that it was safe to return Torin then cites the exact law that the EPA is violating and the number of regulatory duties that are violated as well Torin has caught the EPA in direct violation of a federal law punishable by up to 10 years in prison as well as a 250 000 fine for each violation Before the EPA did the tests independent tests were done in which the machines that do the air quality testing were so full of junk that they couldn t be read If that is the case Torin adds You must by law throw the sample out What was in the readable air samples Sampling of bulk materials and dust found generally low levels of asbestos Since Torin has worked with hazardous materials for over 12 years specializing in asbestos abatement he knows quite a bit about the industry There is no such thing as a low level of asbestos Bulk samples by Federal law either are 1 or are not 1 asbestos containing materials Bottom line the EPA failed to perform its duties in regards to 9 11 and actively encouraged people to enter an unsafe area containing hazardous materials As anyone working in the asbestos industry Torin wanted to land the contract to clean the asbestos in the World Trade Center We all wanted the contract you could clean a small section sell the contract and retire It was known in the industry as basically a goldmine of an asbestos abatement job a contract worth over 3 billion dollars Instead the owner of the World Trade Center complex Lucky Larry Silverstein actually made billions through insurance purchased before the towers destruction A critical slide in the presentation of Rudolph Giuliani is displayed next It should be noted that Giuliani agreed with Christine Todd Whitman that the air at ground zero was safe Giuliani was appointed U S attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983 So he knew a thing or two about criminal investigation procedures Torin adds Knowing that one has to wonder why he sent more than 99 of the steel from the WTC to China and Korea in violation of proper chain of evidence Not only that it was sent overseas at a price undercutting a New Jersey company A company in New Jersey offered to pay 0 56 per ton but it was sent out of the country to be smelted before experts could analyze the steel for signs of explosives for 0 50 per ton Giuliani is clearly one of the perpetrators behind the crimes of 9 11 and he was confronted recently by a truth squad led by Luke Rudkowski They wanted to know why his story has changed five times about his activities on the morning of 9 11 So what does Torin think took down the WTC buildings Different forms of thermite such as thermate and one called super thermite If I was demolishing a building as high as the WTC I would use thermite It does what I want when I want Torin then gets into the science of thermite and what its actual chemical composition is The same chemical composition found in the previously molten metal microspheres found in the WTC dust discovered by professor Steven Jones The WTC microsphere samples showed the presence of aluminum Al magnesium Mg manganese Mn potassium K copper Cu and sulphur S Torins explanation continues The presence of sulphur in steel makes it brittle and lowers its melting point Sulphur is NOT used in structural steel because of this Powdered iron oxide Fe2O4 and aluminum in equal parts make a compound called thermite Add sulphur to thermite and you have a compound called thermate which is used in heavy demolition Torin then explains super thermite Add potassium permanganate KMnO4 and cupric sulphide CuSO4 to thermate and you have something called Super Thermite which is explosive and used in mega demolition such as WTC 1 2 For obviously criminal reasons NIST refuses to comment on the presence of Al Mg S K or Cu in the samples Torin finalizes the evidence of explosives with statements made from numerous firefighters and reporters at ground zero such as Capt Karin DeShore of the New York Fire Department Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center WTC 1 there was this orange and red flash Initially it was just one then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode These popping sounds and the explosions were getting bigger going both up and down and then all around the building Torin explains That is a controlled demolition profile she is describing Torin Save it why Because its a demolition angle So who isn t wanted for the crimes of 9 11 Gasps were heard from the audience as information relating to former paid CIA operative Tim Osman having no involvement in the crimes of 9 11 Tim Osman was Osama Bin Ladens CIA codename New evidence has been released in the past month showing how the federal government allowed planes personally chartered by none other than Osama himself to get friends and family out of the country after 9 11 A quote from Osamas FBI page shows that he is in fact not wanted for involvement in the crimes of that day Torin shows a quote from the FBI director at the time Robert Mueller saying that there is no legal proof to prove the identities of the suicidal hijackers Well sourced evidence is then shown from multiple mainstream news articles proving that many of the hijackers are still alive The official story does not add up The strongest part of Torins presentation is saved for the end the aftermath of 9 11 A bleak picture is shown of the results of the false flag attack An invasion of Afghanistan that was on Bush s desk two days before 9 11 over 655 000 admitted dead in the spreading war in the middle east cheap heroin out of Afghanistan that the former Taliban government destroyed soon to be full scale war in Iran several thousand dead troops and an oppressive police state at home being enforced by some of the returning aggravated felons that were doing the same in Iraq We are not deprogrammed after battle Torin explains when covering the mental aspects of war Torins insight as a combat nurse reveals that the actual amount of dead troops numbers around 15 000 17 000 not the 3 500 we have been told If you get shot in combat Bam Clock goes off If you die in transit to a hospital out of Iraq such as Ramstein in Germany you are not an official Iraq casualty The same holds true if the troops out of the country die 24 hours after they were hit in Iraq The official troop death number is just those that have died in action on the ground We are then shown that legally terrorist is a term that can be branded on virtually anyone If you have ever thought of spanking your child running a red light or made someone angry then by this definition you are a terrorist And if you are charged as a terrorist you will be tried in a military court With the power slanted against you in a military court the Hamdi v Rumsfeld case showed us that you do not even have to be released if found not guilty This is a lot to swallow when you realize that such persons are subject to indefinite imprisonment without charges legal representation or any of the other protections guaranteed by the Constitution Torins slide explains Then the definition of domestic terrorism is shown and we all learn that by this definition not wearing your seatbelt jaywalking speeding or spitting on the sidewalk is a terrorist act Fliers are shown next that originated out of the Department of Homeland Security and the Phoenix Arizona FBI office These are shown to policing agencies around the country Torin explains how nearly all of the groups encompass normal citizens who have done no wrong such as Torins favorite Lone Individuals If you don t fit in any group this is it After a brief question and answer Torin ends the presentation with a fitting quote from Thomas Jefferson Dissent is the highest form of patriotism A true patriot and truth activist Torin is dissenting to expose the lies and crimes of our government in order to get it back from the tyrannical criminal group sitting in power now and to return to the Constitution and Bill of Rights If you want to join Torin in this fight or ask him a question he can be heard every Saturday and Sunday on the We The People Radio Network from 12 to 2 pm central After his radio show you can join him in person with an Austin 9 11 truth squad getting the word out on the south steps of the state capital on Congress avenue every Saturday This article is only just a few highlights of Torins

CLUNK I doubt anything I ve ever baked has a less compelling name But truth be told it wasn t the name that attracted me It was an email from a reader wanting to re create something his grandmother had made decades ago And since I m a complete sucker for old time recipes I took the bait This reader I remember his name was Frank though unfortunately I ve long since lost his email recalled an apple pie baked in a rectangular pan with a thinner than normal layer of apples and a white glaze on top Hmmm shouldn t be hard to figure out Still I wanted to find an authentic old time recipe something from I d guess the first half of the last century Which I did fairly easily simply by Googling apple pie rectangular glazed Up popped Apple Slab and I was off to the races Kind of So many recipes so little time Apple Slab had to wait its turn Along with Persian Buns deep fried glazed cinnamon rolls Gooey Cake yeast bread made from fresh ground wheat and something whose name I can t recall a specialty of Marseilles a large flat brioche split lengthwise and filled with pastry cream glazed with a crackly vanilla syrup and topped with toasted almonds Kind of a Bienenstich but lighter Hmmm speaking of Bienenstich there s another one waiting in the wings Even when you work in the King Arthur test kitchen there s STILL not time to bake everything on your sounds good list But what fun we have trying Back to Apple Slab which finally made its way to the top of the pile The recipes I read were all incredibly basic spartan you might call them as so many old time recipes are Make a crust Line with crushed cornflakes Slice apples over Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon Add top crust bake till done Glaze with white icing Yup that was it Bakers could easily follow a recipe like that 70 years ago Now not so much So I took those basic thoughts and gave them a face lift turning them into a 21st century style recipe we can all follow complete with ingredient amounts and baking times The result An apple pie that transports easily in its 9 x 13 pan readily divides itself into 2 dozen easy to plate servings try THAT with a round pie and is ridiculously tasty Frank wherever you are this one s for you Enjoy Make your favorite double pie crust recipe one that uses 2 1 2 co 3 cups of flour I m using my favorite here A Thoroughly Reliable and Tasty Pie Crust Do you have pie crust phobia Follow the step by step photos in our pie crust blog Divide the crust into two parts one should be 3 5 60 of the dough the other 2 5 40 This is easy if you have a scale If you don t eyeball it Shape each piece of crust into a rectangle you re going to be rolling them into rectangles so might as well give yourself a head start Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes till thoroughly chilled Take the larger piece of pastry out of the fridge and put it on a floured work surface Start to roll it into an 11 x 15 rectangle See those light patches That s butter Those big smears of butter help keep your crust tender OK that looks about right Don t worry about the ragged edges they ll disappear under the top crust Now we re going to move the crust to an ungreased 9 x 13 pan Fold in half then in half again Move to the pan with the folded corner right in the center of the pan Unfold Messy huh That s OK Patch up the holes by pushing the pastry together with your fingers or adding a pinch from the excess on the sides Push the pastry up the sides of the pan a bit to make a shallow pastry container for the apples Put the crust in the fridge while you get the apples ready And start preheating your oven to 350 F Next we re going to peel core and slice about 5 large or 6 to 7 medium baking apples I ve chosen Granny Smiths here as our fresh local apples weren t in yet when I was testing this recipe An apple peeler corer slicer makes this task fast and EASY Once the peeper corer slicer has done its work I simply slice the apple in half with a knife and separate the slices I can peel core and slice an apple in just about 10 seconds Here s the chilled crust ready for its apples But first a layer of coarse dry bread crumbs to help absorb the apples juice and keep the crust from becoming soggy I used 1 cup of Panko coarse Japanese style bread crumbs The original recipes I found called for crushed cornflakes which would also be a good option Spread the crumbs evenly over the crust Top with the apples Next sprinkle with 2 3 cup cinnamon sugar I like Cinnamon Sugar Plus superfine sugar mixed with Vietnamese cinnamon Super tasty But you can make your own cinnamon sugar by combining 2 3 cup sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon Ready for its top crust Roll the remaining piece of pastry into a 9 x 13 rectangle Again don t worry too much about ragged edges as my grandma in law used to say It ll all come out in the wet wash Flop the top crust over the apples Yes apples will poke through Seal the edges of the two crusts as well as you can There ll be places where they don t quite meet That s OK If the whole thing has become warm and sticky and hard to work with pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm it up Just before baking slash it 6 or 8 times to allow steam to escape Put the slab in the preheated 350 F oven and bake it for an hour Remove it from the oven it ll be golden brown No beauty queen but icing will help its looks Cool the slab completely before glazing Here s a wonderfully tasty glaze Combine 1 1 2 cups confectioners sugar 1 3 cup boiled cider 1 2 teaspoon cinnamon a small pinch of salt and enough milk or cream to make the mixture drizzlable Don t have boiled cider Use plain milk or cream maple syrup honey or thawed apple juice concentrate Start with 1 4 cup of any of these if you ve made this kind of icing before you know it s easier to add more liquid than to try to take it away Add enough liquid to make the glaze pourable See how thick this is Maybe a little TOO thick for drizzling A teaspoon of cream should take care of that Drizzle the glaze artfully atop the slab It kind of all runs together anyway but it s fun to try to make patterns Cut Serve Enjoy If you serve right away you get these dribbles of glaze down the sides Kind of dresses it up looks wise Taste wise it needs NO help this is one delicious treat And look how easy it is to serve in small pieces compared to pie You can get 2 dozen servings from this pan of Slab try doing THAT with a pie One more look before I finish this off Read rate and review please our recipe for Old Fashioned Apple Slab Tags apple pie apple

s time It s time for Thanksgiving recipes I don t care that it s not even Halloween yet Oh I know how it goes Every year around this time I think I have all this time to post Thanksgiving recipes on this little food blog of mine I think It s not even Halloween yet I ve got all the time in the world Then it happens It s the same every year We dress up our children in Iron Man and Richard Nixon costumes go trick or treating in our quaint little town then by the time they re on their last piece of candy which is actually like twenty hours later it s suddenly Christmas And I m looking around my kitchen and my little food blog like Okay what just happened And then I ask my children if they have any candy left because I m having a wicked sugar craving And they tell me to go bake a pie or something Smart alec little varmints Anyway today I m sharing my step by step method for brining a turkey I brine a turkey every year I brine a turkey every year because it s the right thing to do Brining involves soaking a turkey in a very salty solution for a certain length of time long enough for the salt to infiltrate the turkey and actually alter the molecular structure of the meat It doesn t turn it into a salty mess either It just results in a juicy fantastic turkey If you ve never brined a turkey you ll just have to trust me on this You can buy ready made brining solutions I used to buy one at Williams Sonoma But making one is a cinch too You basically need a bunch of salt and whatever other ingredients you want to throw in I like to balance the saltiness with the mild sweetness of apple cider and okay the not so mild sweetness of brown sugar but you can use whatever you d like A couple of important things to remember though 1 Only brine fresh turkeys Brining a frozen turkey is never a good idea because frozen turkeys are most typically injected with a sodium solution There are some organic frozen turkeys my friend Julie found some at Whole Foods recently that have a much lower concentration of the sodium solution Generally speaking though you ll want to brine fresh not frozen turkeys 2 Making gravy from the drippings of a brined turkey can result in a really salty gravy if you re not careful In the next post I ll show you a few steps that will prevent this from happening But for now let s brine Here s what you need Cut off the top and bottom of each orange Carefully slice off the peel in sections Mmm Fragrant to the max Strip the leaves off the rosemary sprigs measure the salt sugar bay leaves and peppercorns Inhale Exhale Thank the Lord above for the aromas that spring forth from the earth At least that s what I do every time I make this turkey brine Oh and you ll need some minced garlic I just forgot that step Happens Pour three cups of apple cider into a stock pot Add two gallons of water A cup and a half of salt Two cups of brown sugar Bay leaves Rosemary Peppercorns And orange peel And the forgotten garlic Loveliness Now bring the mixture to a boil then immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature feel free to stick it in the fridge or freezer halfway through the cooling down process This is an alien hand left and a brining bag I m obsessed with brining bags Obsessed It s all I think about anymore Here s the turkey inside the brining bag Once the brine solution is cooled pour it over the turkey Now you ll just need to seal up the bag and refrigerate it for at least sixteen hours Twenty four hours is better though especially for a large turkey Place the turkey breast side down in the bag but 2 3 of the way through the brining flip the turkey in the bag to make sure it brines evenly Just pretend you re an obstetrician and you re trying to get a breach baby to flip Note This is enough brine for a 20 pound turkey If you feel as though the turkey needs even more liquid just top it off with more water and it ll be fine If you re using a much smaller turkey or a turkey breast just halve the recipe Next up Roasting this dang thing The fun has only just begun Prep Time 10 Minutes Cook Time 15 Minutes Difficulty Easy Servings 18 Ingredients 3

into a large brining bag or pot Place uncooked turkey in brine solution then refrigerate for 16 to 24 hours When ready to roast turkey remove turkey from brine Submerge turkey in a pot or sink of fresh cold water Allow to sit in clean water for 15 minutes to remove excess salt from the outside Discard brine Remove turkey from clean water pat dry and cook according to your normal roasting

Christmas my true love gave to me Cornmeal Black Pepper Rosemary Butter Cookies After several weeks of nearly non stop high intensity cookie baking I present you with the final cookie of this year s Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry Night bake a thon TA DA In the kick off post I set the stage for this completely new collection of cookies most of which break rather dramatically from the traditional holiday cookies of my childhood I really wanted to push my understanding of what makes a remarkable and thus memorable Christmas cookie I wanted to try new and exciting flavor and texture combinations I wanted to stretch myself as a baker As I say in the Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry Night kick off post I wanted to throw tradition to the proverbial wind this holiday season However I did not change my basic tenets of what makes a cookie a HOLIDAY cookie Many cookies perhaps MOST cookies do not fill this bill in my estimation Here are the tenets I presented in the Twelve Days of Christmas Deck the Halls kick off post A holiday cookie must be Very very buttery Dry light tender and or crisp rather than chewy or moist An excellent keeper must store and or freeze for 3 weeks Small in size so you can serve and eat a variety Beautiful and festive Fun to make fun to eat fun to give All of this year s Christmas cookies meet these requirements And several of them are so incredible that I will not be able to wait until next December to bake and eat them again The cookie you are looking at is one of those cookies The first words out of MauiJim s mouth after eating this cookie and wiping the butter off his lips was You CANNOT share this recipe Then he proceeded to eat 6 more cookies claiming they were defective and thus not attractive enough for the photo shoot In truth he prefers the defective ones anyway You know the cookies that are a little too brown around the edges He says he wishes I would overbrown all of the cookies even though it mars their appearance Does he think those overbrowned edges on half of the cookies happen by carelessness Ha When I asked him why I shouldn t share the recipe he said WAY TOO GOOD This one goes in the vault Well I agree that these cookies are some of the best I ve ever created but it s Christmas and Christmas is about sharing your very best I want you to taste these amazing morsels so light crisp crunchy spicy and redolent with fresh rosemary and cornmeal And I can t unfortunately bake them for you So over loud protests from the love of my life I make you this little offering from my heart to yours I hope these special cookies add a little spicy sparkle to your holiday festivities TECHNIQUE NOTE To make these cookies extra easy I used my favorite no hassle shaping technique which does however require a 70 scoop available in kitchenware stores If you prefer to roll the dough out on a lightly floured pastry cloth using a cloth covered rolling pin and then cut them out with cookie cutters that is certainly an option Cornmeal Black Pepper Rosemary Butter Cookies This wonderful cookie is inspired by the cornmeal butter cookies made by Italian bakers in Italy and America alike I first sampled a cornmeal cookie many moons ago in a small Italian bakery in San Francisco As I recall the bakery featured half a dozen or more varieties of cornmeal cookies I was enthralled because the notion of adding cornmeal to cookie dough had never occurred to me This was before all the great Italian baking books that widened our horizons a few years later I loved the corn flavor and the open crunchy texture immediately Since then I have created many riffs on this traditional cookie but this is my new favorite 2\u00bd cups King Arthur unbleached all purpose flour 1 cup fine cornmeal\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt 1\u00bd cups fresh unsalted butter at cool room temperature 3 cubes 1 cup sugar2 teaspoons almond extract2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced Finishingcoarsely ground black pepperclear sugar sprinkles I used Wilton s Pearlized Sprinkles In a large mixing bowl sift the flour add the cornmeal and salt Whisk the mixture well to evenly distribute Reserve In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together the butter and sugar Add the almond extract pepper and rosemary and incorporate Add the flour mixture and mix very briefly on very slow speed just until a dough forms Using a 70 scoop 1 tablespoon with a release mechanism scoop balls of dough leveling each ball with the edges of the scoop Thus each ball will have one flat surface You can arrange the dough balls closely together on a baking sheet cover with plastic wrap and chill for as long as a couple of days or proceed immediately to baking Coat a baking sheet lightly with vegetable spray Arrange 12 cookie balls flat sides down 2 inches apart on the baking sheet Lay a sheet of waxed paper over the cookies and using a meat pounder or other heavy flat object gently flatten each cookie ball to a \u00bc inch thickness Coarsely grind black pepper over each cookie and then sprinkle each cookie with clear sprinkles Bake each sheet of cookies at 350 for about 15 minutes rotating the pan at the halfway point to ensure even browning Remove from the oven loosen each cookie with a thin spatula and let cool for 3 4 minutes on the pan Remove cookies from the cookie sheet and place on a wire rack and cool completely Store airtight in layers separated by wax paper rounds in a cookie tin in a cool dry place These cookies improve with age They keep for 3 4 weeks Cookies may also be frozen Makes about 6 dozen 2\u00bc inch diameter cookies There s More Check out the entire Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry Night collection as well as the kickoff

demanded that i hand over my secrets some good came from all this abuse though it got me thinking about all the thrifting tips i ve come up with over the years then i remembered how much i like making lists and i decided to combine the two would you like to see it of course you would diana s thrifting tips go regularly and go on off hours the first helps you acquire more goodies the second is for sanity s sake seriously though if you don t go on a regular basis you re just asking to miss all the good loot you can take this a step further and inquire about restocking day as in when do they do it then mark that day down in your little black book and make sure you go a lot of the larger more established thrift shops especially in bigger towns and cities have last chance outlet and as is shops what this really means is this is the place where we send all the goodies that didn t sell in our full price shops tucson has outlet shops for both goodwill and the salvation army all clothes are 1 3 except for on half price day which seems to be every day i ve gone in i can t even begin to explain how wonderful these places are it s amazing what treasures make it to these shops the ladies at the goodwill outlet told me clothes only get one week on the full priced store racks before they get bundled up and shipped to the outlet i didn t tell my bitter friend this but it s not just a chanel that i ve thrift scored i found a vintage burberry trench at one of these outlets recently for 2 98 seriously make a list of what you need and refer back to it to avoid stocking up on things you don t need also racks of 3 clothes are not an excuse to inundate your closet with heaps of poor quality crap there is no excuse for that maintain your standards ladies shop off season you ll find

i like leggings long slim fitting tank or tee shirt style dresses a loose fitting cardigan and slip on flats if you re not wearing socks at least slip a pair in your bag for trying on shoes not doing so is gross and i will judge you you can also take an even easier route and throw a flexible sewing tape in your bag for taking measurements right there at the racks make sure you have accurate

of any type of calorie During weight gain your liver is being punched in the nose by inflammatory metabolic flu signals coming from your white adipose tissue stored fat and from your digestive tract bacterial imbalance LPS Candida etc At the same time your white adipose tissue is unable to store fat fast enough turning to the primary backup location for fat storage your liver Now your liver gets clogged with excess fat metabolism becomes even more strained your waistline expands and you are at risk for developing far more serious health problems This liver problem is not a simple nutrient deficiency issue although many nutrients can help unclog the situation This is a problem of stuck and stagnant fat congesting your liver The problem spills over into your gall bladder which is the primary reason 600 000 gall bladders are yanked out of Americans every year As the problem persists over time the inflammatory metabolic flu signals literally cook the fat making your liver look progressively more like a crispy slice of bacon than a functioning body organ The more bacon like your liver becomes the more difficult it is to lose weight It is not a pretty picture Your Liver Struggles to Keep Up If your liver cannot handle the excess fat and sugar coming at it then fat and sugar will pile up in all the wrong places all over your body hardening your arteries your brain and generally accelerating aging across the board Thus it is appropriate to think of your liver not only as a back up system trying to cope with excess but as an organ of last resort a type of a last stand before more difficult health issues take hold Unfortunately your liver is expected to deal with this problem with both hands tied behind its back For example the excess leptin production from white adipose tissue causes a depression in its companion hormone Adiponectin Protein hormone that modulates metabolism including glucose and fatty acid catabolism High levels are associated with low body fat Low Adiponectin Protein hormone that modulates metabolism including glucose and fatty acid catabolism High levels are associated with low body fat in turn causes insulin resistance in your liver which raises your blood sugar and simultaneously converts sugar to fat in your liver Now your liver cannot process carbohydrates properly resulting in easy weight gain or weight regain from eating carbohydrates Having a fatty liver elevates the risk for type 2 diabetes by 500 Fluctuating blood sugar levels or elevated blood sugar in association with excess body weight are predictive of a clogged liver Conversely when you are able to eat a normal amount of carbohydrates and not gain weight from them your liver is functioning better This is one reason why Rule 5 of the Leptin Diet Reduce the Amount of Carbohydrates You Eat is so important to help get your metabolism back on track when you are overweight When your liver is clogged with fat it has difficulty breaking down fat to use as fuel Your liver and white adipose tissue are constantly breaking down and restoring fat triglycerides The problem is that once the liver is clogged then the process becomes imbalanced and tilts more towards fat storage than fat break down This is reflected by elevated triglycerides in your blood In fact as your triglycerides begin to elevate from weight gain they actually turn off gene function in your liver that causes fat to pile up in your liver Your fasting triglycerides should never be more than twice as high as your HDL Cholesterol High density lipoprotein that is one of five lipoproteins that enable cholesterol and triglycerides to be transported within the bloodstream to the liver and to the adrenals ovaries or testes for the production of steroid hormones number The best chance you have of clearing triglycerides from your blood is by not snacking between meals Rule 2 and not eating after dinner at night Rule 1 Of course if you eat meals that are too large violating Rule 3 you simply overwhelm your liver with too much to do When your triglyceride number comes down you have created an environment wherein your liver now has the potential to dump clogged fat Conversely when your triglyceride number stays elevated even if you are eating better it is reflective of a liver clogged with fat If you are consistently exercising then your muscles need fuel and your liver will help send fuel in their direction If you are too inactive then your liver is confronted by a huge problem of what to do with all the excess fat and sugar Your white adipose tissue is bursting at the seams your liver itself is drowning in surplus and no place in your body needs all that is available To cope with this situation your liver turns on a last ditch backup mechanism by dumping the excess calories back into your digestive tract This process is incredibly incredibly inefficient and is the antithesis of what your body is designed to do efficiently extract calories from food and get them into your body Never in your body s wildest genetic dreams did it think it would need to cope with being poisoned by too much food To perform this magical feat your body now synthesizes extra cholesterol and bile as a mechanism to export the fat into your digestive tract This has the side effects of elevating your LDL cholesterol Low density lipoprotein It is a group of lipids and proteins that allow lipids like cholesterol triglycerides and fat soluble nutrients Vitamin A D E K Q 10 carotenes to be transported with the water based bloodstream and causing indigestion and heartburn This much bile which often includes excessive bilirubin is highly caustic to the lining of your small intestine and can readily move backwards into your stomach as the primary cause of what doctors call acid indigestion In addition to the explanations for digestive problems given in previous articles in this series this is a primary reason why people take various types of antacid medications not even addressing the source of the problem Elevated LDL cholesterol Low density lipoprotein It is a group of lipids and proteins that allow lipids like cholesterol triglycerides and fat soluble nutrients Vitamin A D E K Q 10 carotenes to be transported with the water based bloodstream in conjunction with an expanded waistline is highly predictive of a clogged liver Your liver requires protein to get itself into metabolic action This is why I recommend higher protein at breakfast Rule 4 It is one reason whey protein has been shown to lower cholesterol and triglycerides in overweight humans Friendly flora helps protect your GI tract from bile related irritation but the lack of friendly flora causes digestive imbalance that is yet another metabolic stressor directly leading to fatty build up in your liver Stress can adding insult to injury Higher stress levels induce more cortisol release to buffer the inflammatory effects of stress It has now been discovered that as cortisol levels rise a protein in your liver elevates HES1 which turns off the ability of your liver to break down fat This also contributes to fatty liver and abdominal weight gain All Five Rules of the Leptin Diet are the basic strategies to unclog your liver Following them consistently does just that Extra fiber is important to help absorb the excess fat cholesterol and toxins that are being dumped out friendly flora to help protect against the caustic effects of bile and higher amounts of DHA Docosahexaenoic acid Essential omega 3 fatty acid integral to the health of all cell membranes nerve and brain function Must be gotten through the diet via cold water oceanic fish or some very limited plant sources or taken as a supplement a natural degreasing compound for your liver that lowers your triglycerides In articles 2 5 of the Leptin Diet Weight Loss Challenge I describe various additional problems that are common in stubborn weight loss Each one of these problems stresses out your liver and contributes to accumulation of fat in your liver Therefore improvement with any of these areas especially to the point of engaging consistent weight loss helps gradually unclog your liver over time This is reflected not only by weight loss but in trend improvements in your waistline blood sugar triglycerides and LDL cholesterol Low density lipoprotein It is a group of lipids and proteins that allow lipids like cholesterol triglycerides and fat soluble nutrients Vitamin A D E K Q 10 carotenes to be transported with the water based bloodstream The rest of this article is devoted to strategies which speed up the process of unclogging your liver and improving your metabolism These strategies are especially relevant to someone who isn t making progress even when implementing solutions given in earlier articles These strategies can be employed by anyone to help speed up the process The basic solutions I have given in previous Leptin Diet Weight Loss Challenge articles along with consistent exercise provide the foundation for getting your liver working better If you are engaging the weight loss process while employing them then your liver is improving In terms of your minimum daily requirement for additional nutrient support your goal is functional and practical Do enough to engage the process of weight loss and consistently maintain the trend Exercise to Help Fatty Liver Consistent exercise is vitally important to resolving the issue of a fatty liver This is because exercise creates a demand for calories to flow to muscles helping your liver have preferred options regarding where to send calories If you are fit enough and get a good response to intense exercise it will produce the best results However a number of studies are showing that moderate consistent exercise can definitely improve this problem Obese individuals who walked on a treadmill for 1 hour per day improved insulin resistance boosted Adiponectin Protein hormone that modulates metabolism including glucose and fatty acid catabolism High levels are associated with low body fat levels lowered free radical damage and improved fatty liver problems Another study showed that placing sedentary obese adults on a 4 week aerobic cycling and stretching program cleared out 21 of their liver fat clearly helping to unclog their livers An animal study seeking to document molecular mechanisms showed that 3 aerobic sessions per week were adequate to reduce weight gain shrink belly fat and clear out liver fat In humans who lost weight and then exercised 40 minutes twice a week even if they regained a slight amount of weight they did not regain dangerous fat that is associated with fatty liver I would always suggest more exercise than this study However the study shows that keeping up even a moderate exercise program can prevent sliding back into the fatty liver problem I have also pointed out recently that strength training is likely to help fatty liver This is because fatty liver disturbs growth hormone signaling that also contributes to fatty liver On the other hand strength training along with reducing inflammation helps condition growth hormone signaling to be normal Consistent exercise needs to be part of any weight loss strategy It needs to be maintained following weight loss to ensure your body stabilizes while you make new and more metabolically fit fat cells over time and your old unfit ones die off Exercise turns on genes that enhance metabolic function that simply will not turn on if you aren t active It is more important to be consistent than intense No matter what your current level of fitness find activities you can do consistently and gradually increase your intensity Sooner or later you will get to a level of fitness that tilts fat burning in your favor not to mention improving liver and cardiovascular health Nutrients to Help Liver Stagnation A lipotropic nutrient is one that helps fat flow out of your liver Such nutrients are involved in fat metabolism in one way or another and often support natural liver detoxification processes as well Fat soluble antioxidants such as tocotrienols vitamin D lipoic acid and silymarin protect your liver which is under more duress when it is fatty The antioxidant N acetyl cysteine NAC has also been shown to protect your liver against fatty liver damage While you need to engage and sustain the process of weight loss to solve fatty liver problems over time various nutrients can play a supportive role either by helping the fat flow or by protecting your liver In addition to fiber DHA Docosahexaenoic acid Essential omega 3 fatty acid integral to the health of all cell membranes nerve and brain function Must be gotten through the diet via cold water oceanic fish or some very limited plant sources or taken as a supplement and friendly flora that were mentioned earlier additional nutrients can be of support Some individuals may benefit from guggulsterones if their LDL cholesterol Low density lipoprotein It is a group of lipids and proteins that allow lipids like cholesterol triglycerides and fat soluble nutrients Vitamin A D E K Q 10 carotenes to be transported with the water based bloodstream is elevated and especially if they also have indigestion This nutrient can help your liver dispose of cholesterol and fat into your digestive tract without making extra bile that burns the lining of your digestive tract This function is synergistic with increased fiber intake and friendly flora and possibly the use of digestive enzymes The obvious result is not needing to take any type of antacid because you have finally addressed the source of the problem B vitamins play an important role in this regard Two nutrients in the B vitamin family choline and inositol are well documented as lipotropic nutrients The Amino Acid Building blocks of peptides and protein and have multiple roles of function in life including muscle function growth detoxification and metabolic pathways and neurotransmitter function Methionine An essential amino acid which serves as a methyl donor and is involved with the biosynthesis of other nutrients Improper conversion is associated with production of homocysteine and atherosclerosis can be converted to choline as well as being vital to your liver s clearance of toxins Proper Methionine An essential amino acid which serves as a methyl donor and is involved with the biosynthesis of other nutrients Improper conversion is associated with production of homocysteine and atherosclerosis metabolism requires B6 B12 and folic acid In other words a good multiple vitamin is needed for basic liver related fat and toxin processing metabolism My two favorite lipotropic booster nutrients are acetyl l carnitine ALC and pantethine ALC has the unique ability to metabolize damaged fat fragments out of your liver as well as your brain ALC helps the process of beta oxidation which enables your cells to use fat as a fuel for energy production Animal studies show that ALC can even restore age related malfunction of cellular fat metabolism ALC has been shown to improve liver health in those with highly compromised liver function Pantethine is to fat what a freight train engine is to box cars providing the metabolic energy to haul fat around and take it where it needs to go 600 mg of pantethine per day for six months was shown to help individuals clear out fatty liver and lower triglycerides These nutrients also do double duty as they are two of the best to help with stress which can also help cause fatty liver There are actually many other nutrients that have been shown to help fatty liver problems including green tea curcumin quercetin theanine grape seed extract hawthorn and Resveratrol Natural phenol or type of antioxidant found in red grapes red wine Research has shown beneficial effects as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents along with supporting healthy blood sugar and cardiovasculature function I m sure there are many others The important point is that many dietary supplements both basic and more advanced have a beneficial impact on liver health and fatty liver in particular This highlights once again the extreme importance of good nutrition to optimal health It is not that you need to do all of these things I am simply illustrating how many potential options you have to help solve this problem Your goal is providing enough support to consistently engage the process of weight loss How Not to Help Your Liver Those surfing the Internet for ways to help their liver are likely to come upon various programs proclaiming a liver flush liver detox or some type of extended fasting Liver detoxification is something that goes on every day of your life There is no such thing as doing a liver detox program and now your liver is somehow magically squeaky clean Any nutrients including various herbs not mentioned here that support lipotropic function toxin clearance or liver protection may be of value as part of a program They are not a magical remedy Fasting for longer than a few days can be extremely hard on your liver The rationale behind it is that because your liver has been overloaded by eating too much then not eating much of anything for an extended period of time will give it a break and help dump the stagnant fat and toxins There is an element of truth to this notion but it is not without rather significant risk When you don t eat protein then your liver actually slows down and you can seriously impair your metabolism and detoxification function When scientists want to study animals with defunct liver function they simply take the protein out of their diets until their livers quit working Even upon protein re feeding it can take six months for their livers to recover It is far better to follow the Five Rules of the Leptin Diet and provide related support as I have suggested This will gradually undo the problem over time without running the risk of fast induced liver trauma The gall bladder liver flush is mostly a sick joke It typically involves fasting on apple juice for several days then consuming large mounts of olive oil citrus juice and Epsom salts The substances seen in the stool following this effort are not gall stones but rather the oil itself forming soft complexes I never recommend this for anyone Using Whey Protein to Help Unclog Your Liver If you are overweight and your diet is high in carbohydrates then it is helping to cause fatty liver This has been confirmed in human studies and the details of the chemistry have been explored in animal studies Too many high glycemic refined flour products white rice and refined sugar are a clear path to fatty liver because the excess insulin stimulates the formation of fat in the liver Furthermore a detailed human study shows that lowering dietary carbohydrates stimulates the break down of fat in the liver and helps clear out the problem It was found that such individuals naturally gravitate to higher protein intake to make up for the reduced carbohydrates most likely to protect against muscle breakdown as a potential fuel source compared to the preferred fat breakdown It has been confirmed that higher protein intake activates fat burning following the meal Furthermore it has been confirmed that whey protein is the best known form of protein for this effect Utilizing a higher level of whey protein intake can have multiple beneficial impacts on metabolism A recently published study with obese non diabetic women had them take 20 grams of whey protein three times a day for four weeks At the end of the study they had a 20 reduction in unhealthy liver fat a 15 reduction in triglycerides and a 7 reduction in total cholesterol Another 12 week study showed that whey protein compared to other proteins or sugar reduced triglycerides cholesterol and improved insulin function Whey protein specifically helps prevent muscle loss during weight loss while enhancing insulin signaling It also helps reduce your appetite while enhancing your exercise response and improving strength The multiple benefits of whey make it an ideal source of protein calories in support of weight management It is nice to see so much science supporting a strategy I have used for many years to help individuals jump start their weight management efforts The program is fairly simple Your meals will center on three protein drinks per day Use 1 1 \u00bd scoops of whey protein and mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of supplemental fiber This can be mixed in 2 milk though you can use rice milk almond milk or 50 fruit juice and 50 water stay away from soy milk as it slows down metabolism The extra fiber is really important otherwise bowels will slow down and toxins can back up Have a serving of fruit with each meal including at least one banana a day to support potassium intake The fruit can be blended into the protein drink or eaten after Take all your regular supplements and I would suggest some extra chlorella for your greens as well as detox support Coffee or tea in moderation is acceptable if desired Cream or half and half may be used in moderation but no sweeteners of any type may be added to anything The first day is the hardest as the leptin urges to eat are still in full swing Cravings tend to disappear by day two or day three at the latest This program can be done for 3 days a week or two or a month In such a case every three or four days have a regular meal of 500 600 calories with no dessert and minimal carbohydrates This program helps to get you going helps get you back on track and can help get you out of a sluggish rut so you can get yourself pointed in the right direction It tends to shrink your stomach so you feel full on less food and is one of the fastest ways to re balance leptin that is just too out of whack It helps to change your taste system so that fruit and other carbohydrates are now plenty sweet This program is not a long term strategy it is more of a corrective strategy that also helps unclog your liver and re balance your leptin system Ensure you get adequate sleep while doing this program Do not attempt it if you know your sleep time is being cut short Likewise stress should be as minimal as possible during this program Individuals with weak liver or kidney function should not do this program as the weakened organs may not be able to keep up with the increase of protein driven metabolic activity Some people cannot handle this much whey protein due to digestive gas bloating which is caused by underlying bacterial imbalance that should be addressed instead A very few people unfortunately just don t do well on whey protein The goal is not to push yourself through feeling miserable because you somehow think you are doing yourself good It really doesn t take more than a day or two to get on track if things are going as they should At some point you will need to eat more carbohydrates to sustain muscle function and electrolyte balance so you can t keep doing this indefinitely These suggestions are given for informational purposes If you have any questions about your specific health issues or ability to do this program then consult with your doctor for advice Summary Your liver is the brain of your body and it must work right for your metabolic and fat burning ability to be normal and healthy Getting your liver to work better takes time and requires that you engage weight loss as a trend Your basic tools for doing this are following the Leptin Diet exercising consistently and basic dietary supplements that support weight management as explained in the first article in this series Other issues relating to digestion toxins metabolic flu and germ gangs as explained in articles 2 5 in this series are also important to consider If you have problems with any of these topics which is typical when weight is not readily responding to better diet and exercise then these issues should be addressed to help engage the process of weight loss Any of these issues also cause liver stress and contribute to fatty liver Sometimes it is helpful to specifically address the issue of liver health as a liver clogged with fat is a weak link in the metabolic chain This can be done by increasing lipotropic nutrients and nutrients that protect your liver It generally means restricting carbohydrates somewhat not completely so as to induce fat burning This can be enhanced with a higher protein intake especially whey protein A 1 4 week program utilizing whey protein at each meal may help get you on track or help you break through a weight loss plateau Over the long haul your ability to be consistent with your program and keep the weight loss process engaged is vitally important Diversions from the successful path need to be corrected sooner than later There is no short cut but there is a clear path Learn to enjoy the path and you will have gone a long way towards making major improvements in your quality of health You are really winning when the improved feeling of health in your body outweighs the urges to eat too much of the wrong kinds of food weight loss, fatty liver, liver flush, gallbladder, bile, leptin, adiponectin, insulin resistance your liver plays a central role in the metabolism of any type of calorie. during weight gain your liver is being punched in the nose by inflammatory metabolic flu signals coming from your white adipose tissue (stored fat) and from your digestive tract (bacterial imbalance, lps, candida, etc.). at the same time your white adipose tissue is unable to store fat fast enough, turning to the primary backup location for fat storage &#8211; your liver. and

challenged this recipe is your new best friend I first saw this pie over at Lisa s blog and I knew I had to give it a try it looked delicious While I have no problem making pie crust so many people have had bad experiences making pie crust from scratch and have just given up It does take practice This recipe was intriguing as it uses refrigerated pie crust I normally do not like the texture of refrigerated pie crust as opposed to homemade but a homemade pie crust is unnecessary here With all the sticky goodness on top of this pie your crust efforts would be lost in the shuffle Save homemade crust making for another pie where the crust is showcased This pie is absolutely fantastic and after the hubby and I ate our share we both agreed we prefer this apple pie to regular apple pie any day That shocked me but it s that good The flavor is out of control gooey cinnamony and just overall out of this world We are just done with regular apple pie can you believe it I still can t Make this make this make this for Thanksgiving you will save yourself a million hours and can concentrate on other desserts you want to serve Also you do not have to worry about making the crust look pretty with fluted edges because you are going to flip it over another plus Coat a deep dish pie plate with nonstick cooking spray and line it with parchment paper Coat the paper with cooking spray also Now I used a deep dish pie plate the Emile Henry brand from Williams Sonoma and it is a little deep for refrigerated dough there is not a lot of hangover for sealing the two crusts together I think a regular pie plate would be fine In a small bowl combine 4 Tablespoons of melted butter brown sugar and pecans Mix well and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie plate on top of the parchment Place one of the crusts in the pie plate pressing it firmly against the nut mixture and up the sides of the plate Set aside In a large bowl combine granulated sugar flour cinnamon and the remaining 2 Tablespoons of melted butter Mix well Add the apples in and toss gently to coat Spoon into the pie crust Place the second crust over the apple mixture Trim and fold the edges together to seal and cut some slits in the top of the crust for venting Because my pie dish is so deep I sealed the edges the best I could I really couldn t fold and seal but it didn t matter at all Bake 1 to 1 1 4 hours or until crust is golden brown in a 375 degree oven Mine took 1 1 4 hours in the bottom third of my oven Make sure to place a cookie sheet on the bottom oven rack to catch any drips from the pie Let the pie cool for 5 minutes and then place a plate that is larger than the pie on top of it and flip it over Use oven gloves as it will still be hot Remove the pie plate and gently lift the paper Allow to

like to delve deeper into this issue When I order a frou frou drink it s a treat I am treating myself for doing good things like pilates yoga or for allowing someone to pull in front of me on the highway And even though I feel that I ve earned the right to a calorie laden caffeinated cup of 16oz bliss I cringe when asked if I d like whole milk or skim Of course I want whole milk I just don t want to have to say that I want it If I ask for whole there would be absolutely nothing wrong with that But my inner voice who sounds a lot like an angry drill sergeant yells at me about the logic behind drinking a days worth of calories vs eating them I stand firm in my belief that they re not the same If I say skim because I refuse to call a drink skinny I ve sealed myself into the category of delusional Because with all that syrup whipped cream and caramel does it really matter anymore Skim is just a way of making myself sound healthier to the person I m ordering from 80 of the time I ll go with the skim and wonder why I m suddenly in a bad mood and drinking something that I didn t really want So much over thinking makes me crave cupcakes I don t allow the sergeant to come near my baking Even if you re not a fan of pumpkin I m not I think you ll love these cupcakes The pumpkin flavour is there but it s subtle just enough to remind you that it s fall and that you should be enjoying this kind of stuff Plus they re moist Nothing is more disappointing than a beautiful cupcake that tastes like cardboard As for the frosting It s heaven pure heaven If a frou frou coffee drink wanted to be reincarnated in an edible form it would choose to return as this frosting atop these cupcakes It s sweet it s salty it s buttery and it makes you feel chefy the way only caramel making can do You deserve this frosting Pumpkin Cupcakes cupcake recipe adapted from David Leite via smitten kitchen Cupcake ingredients2 cups cake flour2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon ground ginger1 2 teaspoon ground nutmeg1 8 teaspoon ground cloves1 2 teaspoon salt1 4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper8 Tablespoons that s 1 stick of unsalted butter softened to room temperature1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar1 4 cup granulated sugar Note The original recipe calls for 1 3 cup which I think would be a tad too sweet 2 large eggs1 2 cup pain yogurt at room temperature Note The original calls for 1 2 cup of buttermilk which I didn t have on hand Both will work 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract1 1 4 cups canned solid pack pumpkinMethodPreheat the oven to 350 Line cupcake pan s with 18 20 liners Note I managed to scrape up 20 cupcakes but if you can only get 18 no worries Just be sure to fill any empty muffin tins with water before baking In a large bowl sift together the flour baking powder baking soda cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves salt and pepper Whisk and set aside In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or any bowl large enough to accommodate everything if you re using a hand held mixer beat together the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy about 3 5 minutes on high speed Scrape downs the sides of the bowl and one at a time add the eggs beating well after each addition about 1 minute on medium speed Add the vanilla extract and beat to combine Alternate adding the flour mixture and yogurt or buttermilk if using beginning and ending with the flour When using this method of incorporating dry and wet always start and end with the dry Once everything has been combined beat in the pumpkin on low medium speed until the batter is smooth Fill each liner to about 3 4 full Lightly rap the pans on the counter just to release any air pockets So as not potentially set your oven on fire be sure to add a bit of water to any unused tins Bake for 20 23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean Remove from the oven and allow the cupcakes to rest in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack Cool completely before frosting Salted Caramel Frosting Note If you plan on piping the frosting you may want to double the recipe I had about 5 naked cupcakes that required some serious bowl scraping to frost This was sad as it left me with nothing to lick 1 2 cup heavy cream4 tablespoons that s a 1 2 stick of unsalted butter cut into 4 pieces 1 cup granulated sugar1 tablespoon water1 teaspoon sea salt1 4 cup 4 tablespoons 1 2 stick unsalted butter8 Tablespoons that s 1 stick of unsalted butter softened to room temperature3 4 cups confectioners sugarMethodPrepare the caramel Roll up your sleeves and take a deep breath You can do this Have the cream and butter measured out and set aside but within reach In a medium saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water Stir them up a bit just to combine Turn the heat to medium high or just medium if you re nervous I still get butterflies when making caramel Using a wooden spoon stir just until the sugar has dissolved Stop stirring and allow the mixture to come to a boil If one spot appears to be boiling faster than the rest gently swirl the pan around using the handle Continue to boil until the mixture turns a deep amber colour but not too dark Once the colour begins to change keep a close eye on it it can go from amber to black in a matter of seconds Once it s a rich shade of amber remove the pan from the heat and immediately but carefully add the cream and butter The caramel will spit and sputter at you so try not to look it in the eye Stir vigorously until smooth if it seizes up on you just keep stiring and it should iron itself out Stir in the sea salt Set the pan aside and allow it to cool to room temperature In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment a hand held will work too beat the 8 Tablespoons of butter on medium speed until light and fluffy Add about 1 cup of the confectioners sugar and beat on low to combine Add the cooled caramel and continue beating until combined Slowly add 2 more cups of confectioners sugar Don t add it all at once or it ll explode all over the kitchen If the frosting looks too thin add another 1 2 of sugar until it comes to a thicker consistency If it s still too thin blame the caramel and stick the frosting in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes Spread pipe slather the cupcakes as desired Sprinkle with brown sugar or anything else you can think of Makes 18 20 cupcakes "",""url"":""unegaminedanslacuisine 2011 10 pumpkin cupcakes with caramel frosting

information money and identities shutting down businesses and compromising security all over the world As more and more of us have taken to using our mobile phones for browsing the web banking and shopping smartphone only mobile commerce was up 221 this Thanksgiving the risk of cybercrime grows ever larger on mobile devices which criminals are increasingly eyeing as a promising new source of revenue Thankfully mobile cybercrimes are still relatively rare but in recent years major security scares viruses and other mobile crimes have become bigger issues and it s only a matter of time before mobile devices are seeing a scourge of cybercriminal attacks In fact 92 of information security officers believe that mobile payments will cause a serious increase in cybercrime over the next few years Here are some m commerce crime trends to watch out for now and in the coming years as criminals look to take advantage of the security flaws and popularity of mobile browsing and shopping Rootkit installation A rootkit is a particularly stealthy type of software that installs itself on a user s device and hides itself from the normal modes of detection letting it operate in secret to get privileged access to a computer and its user s information In the past these malicious programs were limited to laptops and desktop computers but they re becoming a threat from mobile phones as well as revealed by research at Rutgers in 2010 A rootkit when installed on a phone could affect every part of the phone from the touch screen to the passwords These programs can not only steal information they could potentially even reroute calls from legitimate businesses to criminal operations That s not a threat to take lightly and many are advising mobile users to be careful what they view and with certain operating systems use anti virus and anti malware software Risky QR codes QR codes can be a cool way for consumers to find out more about products and find a wealth of information with very little effort but they re not always safe Mobile phone users never quite know where the codes will take them once scanned and in a growing number of cases QR codes are leading to sites that download a virus or malware onto the user s mobile device Mobile security experts are already seeing a rash of QR code problems and expect them to grow significantly in number over the next year Theft of digital certificates If thieves can bypass a mobile phone s security they can steal digital certificates What are digital certificates They re what verify that a user sending information is who she or he claims to be As you might guess someone else having access to the ability to pretend to be you could be a pretty serious security risk While that risk already exists when you use a PC it s increasingly becoming a concern for mobile users as well and was identified by AVG Technologies as being one of the most pressing issues in mobile security Smishing Like its cousin phishing smishing tries to trick individuals into revealing personal private information Smishers send their victims an SMS text message baiting them into divulging personal details like bank account credit card or social security numbers Smishers often pose as businesses drawing in those who believe they re simply helping keep their accounts in good standing avoiding bogus charges the smishers say they ll owe if they don t comply or sometimes even trying to win a fake prize Sometimes smishers aim to collect personal information directly and other times they are trying to install malware that can allow a phone to be controlled remotely Recent reports place smishing as one of the most common reasons for criminal data loss Social engineering Sadly there s such a big business built up around this kind of mobile crime that there are even common job titles associated with it confirmer is one big one Social engineers scam mobile users by either tricking them into giving them private information or by tricking companies that the individual uses Sometimes criminals will hack into bank accounts and change customer contact information When frauds occur the bank will contact not the customer but the criminal who will verify the charges these are those pesky confirmers Social engineering occurs in such a wide variety of ways that it s hard to fight Consumers will just need to be on their toes and watch out for any unusual activity to avoid becoming victims Unsecured Wi Fi threats Think you re safe from cybercriminals when you re sitting at home using your Wi Fi to browse the web You may not be Wi Fi offers many criminals easy access to your information if you re not careful While a secured home Wi Fi network offers some protection many mobile consumers use public networks for Wi Fi too which can open them up to criminals who steal their personal information or hijack their interactions with banks and businesses Some tests have found that most Wi Fi networks can be hacked in five minutes or less so mobile users should do any private business on their cells while on their mobile plan not Wi Fi Viruses and malware According to McAfee a leading antivirus provider mobile security threats rose by 46 in 2010 Yet a whopping 70 of mobile phone users felt that their smartphones were safe from these kinds of attacks That false sense of security may be leading many mobile users to become unwitting victims of cybercrimes While viruses and malware that attack mobile phones are still rare in comparison to those designed to attack PCs the growing number of smartphones and tablets has become a new ever bigger target for criminals Experts advise not only mobile customers but also businesses to prepare for a growth in this kind of attack by creating more secure apps or payment systems and offering better support to consumers Crimeware App stores open up a wealth of opportunities for criminals to fill your mobile device with crimeware No one would willingly download a program onto their smartphone that would cause them to be the victim of fraud but crimeware is disguised as being a different type of program altogether perhaps a game or a useful utility In fact the app may actually run in that fashion The problem is however that it comes with a tagalong malware or other tracking device that lets criminals access information control the phone and a range of other malicious activites Think it can t happen to you The BBC reports that the proliferation of these apps has increased from just 29 to 62 of all smartphone malware this year Encryption hacking You and the businesses you frequent might think encrypting data keeps you all safe For sophisticated cybercriminals however encryption may not be a roadblock to stealing your personal information your money or your identity It s becoming increasingly easy for criminals to crack the most common types of encryption and with many governments blocking the use of high level encryption technology so that they can break the codes if necessary for law enforcement purposes consumers and businesses alike are stuck in a particular sticky situation Your best bet Be as careful as you can watch for any indications of fraud and use the highest level encryption possible for all sensitive data Electronic eavesdropping Whether you re calling a business to order goods or taking a photo of your home someone can be listening in Unfortunately electronic eavesdropping is possible via a number of different methods It can occur over unsecured Wi Fi networks or through malicious apps but no matter how it happens it s a very serious security threat that could result in large amounts of critical personal information being compromised With a recent report by the Government Accountability Office finding a rise in malicious software aimed at mobile devices of about 185 in just a year there s reason to worry for both businesses who want to keep transactions secure and customers who want to keep information out

up the confusion about cord blood"",""body"":""Like many parents today Amy and Paul Murphy were overwhelmed by the myriad decisions they had to make about the birth of their first child But the decision to bank their newborn baby s umbilical cord blood came relatively easy Because Amy has a family history of leukemia and stem cells from cord blood have been shown to be useful in the treatment of blood cancers they didn t debate the issue for long when their daughter Katie was born they chose to privately bank her cord blood By the time Katie was nine months old the Murphy s realized she wasn t sitting up or moving around as much as other kids her age When she turned 1 her parents discovered she had hypotonia low muscle tone that adversely affects gross and fine motor skills After doing some research they found a Duke University study that was using stem cells from umbilical cord blood to treat kids with cerebral palsy Their decision to privately bank the blood meant they could potentially participate in the study After Katie was accepted she received a cord blood transfusion in January 2010 Despite a dearth of clinical evidence Amy was soon convinced that the transfusion had made a crucial difference in her development I was told not to expect something right away but I thought within the first few months I was seeing little things she remembers I m her mom I m with her all the time and I see her all the time her progress has been so much faster it s incredible Banking on the future That s precisely the message cord blood banks hope people take away from the pamphlets and advertisements that line the pages of parenting magazines and the walls of many doctor s offices Those advertisements are part of the growing trend of private medical businesses targeting patients with hopes that new and as yet largely unproven medical advances might help them if they re willing to pay the price While the Murphys consider Katie s ongoing progress to be a success story even some medical researchers working toward those very advances warn against setting up false expectations I worry private banks misrepresent possibilities said Dr Joanne Kurtzberg program director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at Duke University and the lead researcher on the clinical trial in which Katie took part Using a child s own cord blood is totally experimental Kurtzberg said I believe a parent has the right to privately bank but they need to understand what it can or cannot be used for at this point Besides their use in treating blood diseases cord blood stem cells are considered master stem cells and may also be used in regenerative medicine eventually but that too is unproven as of now All those promises that cord blood can correct damaged organs and degenerative diseases are just speculation Kurtzberg said Dr Irving Weissman director of the Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University holds strong beliefs that stem cell transplants will be used to treat more diseases in the future but he does not advise parents to privately bank because there s no guarantee when if ever that future will come It s a business that has very little positive outcome for the people who do it Weissman said And to the extent that they claim cord blood can regenerate anything but blood they re wrong It s a practice of pressuring young people to pay a significant amount of money for private use I think it s not evidence based Banking cord blood does come at a hefty price Processing fees cost around 2 000 and there is an annual storage fee of about 125 For some however the few advances being made already are proof enough that it s worth the price Heather Brown the Vice President of scientific and medical affairs for Cord Blood Registry one of the largest private cord blood banks in the country is excited for the potential for these cells to be used in regenerative medicine and especially for

launched to encourage cord blood banking Global Stem Cells Market to Reach 64 Billion by 2015 As with all major medical decisions it s wise for parents to do their own independent research If you trust the literature from the private cord blood banks like Cord Blood Registry and Viacord for example both state the chances of needing a stem cell transplant as about 1 in 217 Further research with other organizations shows that number to be closer to 1 in 2 000 Dr John Liu president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry is also confronting a growing stem cell business as tooth banks like StemSave promise to bank dental stem cells for use in future regenerative medicine treatments Stem cell research is not at the point where we can take an individual s stem cells and do a lot of things with it yet Liu warns If parents want to store the stem cells they need to be clearly informed and understand where things are Others like Dr Jeremy Mao director of Columbia University s Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and the Chief Science Advisor for StemSave believe dental stem cells may one day help with such advancements as restoring muscle function Unlike umbilical cord blood dental stem cells have no current clinical applications and are not being used in any human trials Even so these companies charge between 600 to 800 to process the cells and up to 130 in annual storage fees And while tooth banks are not yet as prominent as cord blood banks they are growing quickly enough that the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry released a statement advising parents on the issue They are not the first organization to step in The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on cord blood banking discouraging their patients from private banking unless there is a family history of a proven disease the cells can treat Dr Mitchell Cairo chief of pediatric hematology oncology and stem cell transplantation at the Maria Fareri Children s Hospital at Westchester Medical Center is part of the committee that wrote the original AAP statement and revises it periodically He remains ambivalent at best It s a free market and one can t predict the future Cairo said One makes all kinds of decisions and investments in their life Cairo points out that the growth of these businesses is not unique to stem cells One just has to look around a doctor s office to see a number of businesses promising treatments and storage for something that might benefit the patient in the future He believes the choice to buy into any of these businesses is like the choice people make when they buy types of insurance There may be a low probability but what if you are that 1 in 2 000 Pretty much a miracle That low probability is enough for some parents Tami originally spoke to her doctor about cord blood banking when she was pregnant with her son Blase in 2002 Her doctor convinced her not to bank But Byrd started speaking to Viacord when Blase was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia At the time she was five months pregnant with her third son Bryce She learned if the baby was a match for Blase s stem cells they could be used to treat his leukemia The whole thing was pretty much a miracle Tami said When Bryce was born Tami used Viacord s Sibling Cord Blood Connection to store his stem cells for free Viacord offers to collect and store cord blood at no cost to the family for five years if the family is expecting a child and already has a child with an established diagnosis of a disease that is currently treatable with sibling cord blood After being treated with his brother s cord blood Blase has been cancer free for four years In hindsight Byrd characterizes cord blood banking as a necessity not an option Public vs Private The National Marrow Donor Program also has a Related Donor Cord Blood Program that will store a baby s cord blood at no cost to treat a sibling with a diagnosed disease Most people are not as aware of the NMDP as they are of companies like Viacord They are also less aware that there are public donation options for cord blood that make the cells available to the general public as well as the family that originally donated them as long as they have not been used Kurtzberg thinks this lack of awareness is because private banks are much more aggressive than public banks when it comes to advertising and legislation In the United States there are only 20 public cord blood banks compared to 32 private ones To some the growth of private banks offers more security to parents than those offered by public Our cash flow is such that if we stopped taking new clients we would be able to store and preserve cells that we have in our facility for their lifetime said Kathy Engle director of corporate communications for the Cord Blood Registry The estimated lifetime of stored stem cells is 20 years Anything beyond that is a guess considering the field has only been around for that long Over those 20 years the business surrounding stem cells has improved somewhat According to Dr John Wagner director of hematology oncology blood and marrow transplantation division at the University of Minnesota advertisements are not as misleading as they used to be When these businesses first began Wagner says their marketing clearly made claims that were untrue and exaggerated specifically targeting women in their last trimester Wagner believes the marketing efforts have become more accurate over time and even his views on the issue have changed If asked 10 years ago I would have said Run as fast as you can don t go anywhere near it Wagner said If asked today I might be changing my mind It gives me more hope that this will be something that will be useful While this isn t based on any solid proof Wagner is encouraged by the research It s this research that parents must weigh against the promises made by private stem cell banks and treat them as they would any other investments weighing the options first and weeding out those that are only in the business of selling hope banking cord blood comes at a hefty price&#8212;but for some parents, the few advances being made are all the proof they need to pay up."",""url"":""msnbc msn id

resourceful ranchera woman of long ago took some lowly cow offal and created a stew it became something that is truly greater than the sum of its parts Love or hate it menudo is a classic and you can t say that you really know Mexican food if you have never tasted it Out of all of Mexico s famous caldos this is the one that is most cherished for its restorative powers Feeling timid and weak Its rich spicy broth will put pelos hair on your chest even if you are a girl Sad with a broken heart The tender bites of menudo will console you better than ten mothers who think that telling you Why you crying mija T row him in a traash is consolation enough Nursing a magnificent hangover Eat some red hot menudo and you ll be singing to the radio on your way to work instead of calling in sick again or so I am told They are more like the day I got married and how I was so wound up that I forgot to eat breakfast Or how when my mother found out reminded me that if I didn t eat anything I was going to pass out right in the middle of the ceremony como una gallina asustada like some frightened hen Before I knew it my two sisters wrapped me wedding dress and all in a bed sheet while my mother proceeded to force her eye poppingly hot red menudo down my throat I m sure I got married with menudo breath that day but no matter I was the picture of blissful serenity as I walked down the aisle to meet my fate thanks to the menudo After the wedding reception the real party got started over at my new suegra s mom in law s house where toda la familia celebrated with her Sonora style white menudo and a glass of champagne An unusual pairing to say the least but why not Who says you can t have Mexican food with some fancy French wine Besides it was fabuloso Menudo is customarily eaten early the next day after an all night pachanga a big Mexican shindig but I suppose my cu\u00f1os y cu\u00f1as bros and sisters in law couldn t wait for morning That is how much they and most Mexicans love menudo The one thing we can agree on is this Menudo is wholly satisfying and is perfect just the way it is Thankfully I doubt that it will ever be tweaked or improved upon In other words it might never appear at your local Taco Bell or on the menu at one of those new gourmet read wildly expensive Mexican food eateries They might make the foodies happy but we probably will never eat there We ll take a homemade bowl of cow stomach menudo over a designer taco any day muchas gracias Some will pass up the opportunity to enjoy this fortifying stew but that s okay Entre menos burros hay m\u00e1s elotes With fewer burros there is more corn for the rest us to quote one of my mothers favorite dichos Or to put it very loosely don t be a burro and give menudo a try Red or Sonora Style White Menudo Menudo rojo o blanco al estilo Sonora To purchase the best tripe go to your local Mexican butcher usually early on a Friday You might not find any come Saturday morning The tripe should be white or a light cream with no strong odor Try buying tripe that has washed and scraped of all fat to save time Otherwise scrape off all traces of fat with a sharp knife If you soak the calf s foot pieces in a lemon juice water mixture for the allotted time I promise you the strong cooking odor some people complain about will be kept to a minimum Later your visitors will be surprised you spent the whole day cooking menudo because they won t smell a thing An added bonus very little excess fat Honeycomb tripe pictured above the most popular looks just like its name Most cooks use only honeycomb tripe or a combination of honeycomb and different styles of tripe such as Toalla which looks like a thick fluffy towel hence its name Not pictured The butcher ran out of it before I arrived See what I mean Lebrillo tripe is a lacey delicate looking tripe see picture right It is best used with a heartier tripe such as Toalla or Honeycomb Menudo is best served the same day or the next but no longer So don t cook a large batch unless you know it is going to be all eaten For this recipe I got a little lazy and used Mexican style hominy out a can Shh Don t tell my friend Eva but the next time I cook menudo I will show you how to cook hominy from menudo from scratch and I will post some pictures Dress up your menudo with chopped fresh cilantro sliced green onions dried Mexican oregano lemon wedges Chile piqu\u00edn tiny but intensely hot is the dried chile of choice for white menudo but crushed dried red chile flakes or hot sauce will do fine Don t forget to bring the corn tortillas and an open mind Ingredients 3 lbs honeycomb tripe or a combination with other kinds of tripe depending on your taste\u00bd calf s foot cut into piecesPlenty of water approximately 12 or 13 cups for the menudo The juice of one large or two small lemons About 2 cups cold water5 garlic cloves peeled1 large yellow onion cut in halfSalt to taste\u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper or to taste1 bay leaf \u00bd teaspoon ground cumin or to tasteAt least 2 cups canned Mexican style hominy to your tasteA small spoonful of white vinegar optionalRinse the tripe and the pieces of calf s foot with water and place them in a large pot Pour the juice from the large lemon over them with about 2 cups of cold water to cover and refrigerate for a few hours I let mine soak overnight Rinse the tripe and the calf foot pieces with cold water Place them in a large pot and fill with water to cover plus 1 \u00bd inches approximately 12 to 13 cups Add salt to taste plus the garlic cloves the onion ground black pepper and the bay leaf Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium low Loosely cover the pot and let it simmer for about 45 minutes or more Remove any scum that rises to the top with a large spoon Continue cooking for 5 hours more or until the tripe is nice and tender Total cooking time is about 6 hours Pour boiling water into the pot if the broth starts to evaporate Skim of any excess surface fat with a large spoon Prepare the Red Chile Sauce In the last hour of cooking pour at least 2 cups of the Red Chile Sauce into the pot according to your preference along with the hominy and the cumin No need to add Red Chile Sauce or cumin to the White Menudo Adjust the seasonings does the menudo need more salt Red Chile Sauce ground pepper or cumin Perhaps a small spoonful of white vinegar is just the thing to bring together all of the flavors Use large bowls to serve about 6 persons You can double or even triple this recipe if you want Once you get the hang of it you won t need a recipe at all Tip Start cooking your menudo at around midnight and let it simmer over a low flame all night long Make sure that there is more than the usual amount of water in the pot Wake up early the next morning check the water level and dump the Red Chile Sauce and the hominy into the pot and go back to bed for a little while You ll wake up to freshly cooked menudo Red Chile Sauce RecipeIngredients 8 dried Ancho chiles10 dried New Mexico chiles8 dried California chilesWater Directions Cut the stems from all the chiles Then slice them open and remove all the seeds Place the chiles in a saucepan and cover them with water Place a lid on the saucepan and boil for about 5 or 6 minutes or until the chiles are nice and soft Remove the chiles but do not discard the water In small batches take the chiles along with some of the water and whirl in a blender at high speed Now use a strainer to remove the tiny bits of peel Do this twice to make a super smooth sauce It should pour like spaghetti

"",""body"":""Post written by Leo Babauta Follow me on Twitter Recently my friend and fellow blogger Scott Young did a great post entitled New to exercise Make workouts daily It was an excellent post and perfectly timed as it mirrors my own recent efforts at making exercise a daily habit The problem with trying to make exercise a habit and it s something that we ve all faced is that you usually try to exercise 3 or 4 times a week and that makes creating a new exercise habit difficult The reason is that the more consistent an action is the more likely it is to be a habit Therefore as Scott points out and it s something I fully agree with exercising every day is more likely to result in a habit something that becomes almost automatic and much easier instead of a constant struggle I ve been implementing this idea in my daily life recently alternating every day between different exercises running swimming biking and strength workouts as a way of reaching my goal of completing an Olympic distance triathlon this year I m going to continue this habit change into the month of May I made daily running a habit last year when I was training for my first marathon but this year I stopped when I got sick so I m re starting the habit formation If you re going to make this a habit do a 30 day Challenge and by the end of the challenge your habit should be pretty well ingrained Here are some practical suggestions I ve learned along the way to help make exercise a daily habit Set a time Decide whether you re more likely to stick with it in the morning or lunchtime or evening and stick with that time I ve set the time of 5 30 a m every day and I m trying my best not to vary from that time If you don t set a time you re more likely to put it off until you have more time or energy and then put it off until the next day Soon it s not a habit at all Send yourself a reminder I use Memo to Me but there are a number of ways to send yourself an email or text reminder so you ll never forget Then when you get the reminder do it right away Don t brook any delays Start small This is perhaps the most useful suggestion of all When I start exercising I always start with lots of energy enthusiasm and ambition I think I can do more than I can However doing too much in the beginning leads to burnout which leads to quitting your habit When you first try to make exercise a daily habit chances are your body won t be used to that kind of stress The key only do 20 minutes in the beginning and do it nice and easy Nothing hard Even 10 15 minutes is fine at first if you re just starting out The key is to get out there get your body slowly used to daily exercise and form that habit Progress later Once your body is used to daily exercise you can slowly start to increase the amount and intensity of your exercise Wait at least two weeks before starting to increase that s the minimum your body needs to adjust Once it begins to feel way too easy you can start increasing the length of your workouts to 30 and then 40 minutes and eventually up to an hour Once you do that you can gradually increase the intensity running faster or harder for example Try not to increase both distance and intensity at the same time Make it pleasurable If you associate a habit with pain you will shy away from it But if it s fun you ll look forward to doing it That s why in this beginning stage of my new habit I ve been focusing on pleasure I go slowly enjoying the scenery the fresh morning air the beautiful sky as the sun rises the quiet time of solitude and contemplation It s actually something I enjoy doing An mp3 player with some great music helps Lay out your gear The fewer obstacles and less friction there is in forming your new habit the more likely you are to be successful If you have to not only wake up early but get a bunch of gear together while half awake you might just want to go back into bed But if you lay out your workout clothes and shoes and watch and mp3 player or whatever you need for your exercise you ll be ready to go with no friction at all Just head out the door My rule is just to get my running shoes on and get out the door I don t worry about how long I have to go or how hard it will be Just get out and get started Once I ve done that it s a piece of cake Mix it up One thing I like about triathlon training is that daily exercise isn t boring instead of running every single day now I ve got a variety of sports to do and that makes it much more interesting But perhaps just as important is that with each sport I m using different muscles especially with swimming Sure some of the same muscles are used but they re used differently with different stresses on them What that means is that I m not pounding the same muscles every day That gives them a chance to recover because without recovery you re just breaking your muscles down over and over Have a relative rest day Again recovery is very important Which is why you need to give your body a chance to rest If you re taking it easy and only doing 20 minutes you should be OK without rest days But it s still good to have one day of rest where you re not doing the same exercises as the other six days You don t want to skip the day completely because then you re not being consistent with your habit That s why I do one day of strength training where I don t use the same muscles as swimming biking and running If you need more rest you could just do 20 minutes of walking or even just a session of meditation The key is to do something every day preferably something that gets you moving meditation isn t the best example but at least you d be doing something and keeps your habit formation going Don t skip a day It s easy to say No problem I ve been doing it for five days I ll just skip today But that will make your habit formation harder Consistency is key so try not to skip a single day If you do don t beat yourself up don t judge don t feel bad everyone messes up sometimes and habit formation is a skill that requires practice Just start your 30 day challenge over again and try to identify the obstacle that led to your skipping a day and prepare for it this time ""}"	0.0	0	0.0	?	?	1	8	0.377270247	0	0.120141343	0.420273349	http://zenhabits.net/2007/04/how-to-make-exercise-a-daily-habit-with-a-may-challenge/	921	0.214285714	0.071428571	0.0	0.0

obesity Based on the obesity statistics reported recently anyone can realize the importance of keeping fit by doing exercises For a lot of people getting to the gym is the hardest step However some who did hit the gym decide to give up because they see no significant result after making long and hard efforts The problem lies in the fact that hitting the gym is not enough It is necessary to have an effective exercise program There are some mistakes which are commonly made while one gets started on exercise Here are top 10 common mistakes that people should avoid 1 Improper warm ups Warming up before starting your workout sessions is always necessary A proper warm up way will increase your heart rate range of motion circulation and neural drive to the working muscles Benefits of warming up are more than just loosen stiff muscles When exercisers do it carefully it can actually improve their performance On the other hand an improper warm up or even no warm up at all can greatly increase your risk of injury from engaging in exercise activities A good way of warming up will increase your heart rate range of motion and so on 2 Spot reduction exercises Losing weight in one area of your body is impossible it means that weight loss can never be isolated to a particular area Localized strengthening and toning exercises will only help to firm your muscles and will have no effect on the fat reduction of the target area As shown by many fitness specialists spot reduction is an ineffective method of burning fat Therefore exercisers are strongly recommended to adopt a better alternative method of a well rounded full body weight reduction program This exercise only makes the arms more toned You should follow a well rounded full body weight reduction program 3 Working one muscle at a time Using the type of machines that only focus on a single muscle like the chest press means people are losing a major chance to challenge their body and get stronger When they combine several muscle groups such as abs arm and core at the same time the results will be totally different More calories are burnt and fat is lost quicker Thus instead of using the machines which only stress on your shoulders do alternating leg lunches on a bosu ball while simultaneously raising 5 to 8 pound dumbbells overhead You should feel a sign that you re getting the great workout while you tone 4 Low intensity cardio Steady state cardio has been shown to be less effective in burning fat less useful in improving anaerobic and aerobic capacity Actually low intensity exercises may not be enough to really elevate your heart rate above 100 beats per minute essential for getting in shape and burning calories Just by increasing your speed and intensity you ll start to see major improvements in your fitness level and in your body 5 Inadequate hydration It is estimated that 75 of people are chronically dehydrated Accordingly it s critical to hydrate before you hit the gym floor because if you wait until you re already thirsty you re probably already dehydrated The consequence of this error relates to significant decrements in mental as well as physical performance For an inactive person it is recommended to drink six to eight cups of water per day to prevent dehydration Realistically most active people will need to drink twice that amount so that you can replenish and retain the fluid you ve lost You should drink enough water to avoid dehydration 6 Resting too much It is true that every one should not overdo their workouts however spending too much time taking breaks between exercises can lower the workout benefits and set you up for injury An idle time to move to the next session is about 30 seconds Then you should exercise intensely enough to work up a light sweat get your heart beating at the needed rate to burn fat 7 More is better Studies show that it is unnecessary to spend over an hour doing cardiovascular exercise and the risk of injury overcomes the benefits after 60 minutes For that reason sessions of around 45 minutes most days of the week are recommended for weight loss A complete program of well being requires exercisers to do exercises frequently and have the spiritual and psychological satisfaction Over exercising can lead to many serious consequences 8 Stretching ignorance after your hard sessions Many people take this mistake when they head right to the locker room after finishing the workout In fact doing exercises naturally makes your muscles tighten When your muscles get too tight they pull on your bones and this is one of the biggest reasons people get injuries aches and pains It s best to release the tension and return them to a relaxed state of tension after using your muscles and tightening them up You just simply stretch the main muscle groups such as hip flexors chest outer thighs ankles and shoulders Doing these activities will help increase blood flow and circulation to reduce muscle soreness and attain better posture and alignment Stretching your body after doing exercise to loosen muscles 9 Working out every day It s a big mistake to work out every day as our body needs the rest and recovery time to rebuild and be at its best Doing exercises every day will not make your body get enough recovery so your workout intensity will drop significantly and you may be easy to get bored and lose motivation If you want to be active on your rest day you can do some activities with a low intensity Jogging with your dog in the park is a good recommendation 10 Doing the same thing each time Mentally you ll get bored in doing the same routine over and over again Doing the same movement patterns consistently will result in reduced calories burned and muscle building As a result you should choose to shock your system and switch up your gym process Because our bodies are smart they become very efficient at utilizing the least energy amount possible to perform the same movement Typically your body has a six to eight week learning curve So if you are resistant to change make your cycles every two to three months for your best result return Related links Mistakes To Avoid In Your Bicep Workouts 3 Workout Mistakes

documents have been common use within business for many years Protecting PDFs against change is fast becoming a hot topic Digitally signing PDFs with a certifying signature protects the content and also shows who signed or approved the document This article explains how you can easily digitally sign PDFs it covers what is needed to electronically sign PDF documents and the different types of PDF signatures How to digitally sign PDF documents First you need software that is capable of electronically signing PDFs such as our PDF Sign Seal a desktop application for manual creating PDF signatures or our ADSS Signing Server a server application for bulk automated or web services PDF signing Both are available for evaluation to people that complete our registration process providing they do not use anonymous contact details The other thing you need is a document signing certificate i e your cryptographic signing key again you can get a free key and certificate directly from our site here This PDF document signing certificate proves your identity in the online world and shows that it was indeed you who signed a PDF documen The PDF Signature is created by the PDF signing software using a simple process as follows Ascertia PDF Signing applications make the process of signing a PDF document very simple We support techniques such as signing multiple PDF documents in one go converting Word and other common document types to PDF and signing them in one step one click PDF signing auto signing of multiple pages of a document and also automated bulk PDF document signing on the server e g efficiently signing PDF e invoices in their thousands The main thing is that signing a PDF should be as simple as signing a paper document with a pen and for bulk documents it should be much more efficient Of course there are many types of PDF Signatures and the rest of this article explains some of these The important thing to remember is that PDF signatures are standardised ISO 32000 1 and ISO 19005 1 so it means when you sign a PDF document using standard software like our PDF Sign Seal or ADSS Signing Server then these signed PDF documents can be also be read and verified using other third party PDF software including the ubiquitous Adobe Reader or the increasingly common Foxit Reader and other standards compliant providers Invisible PDF Signatures When you electronically sign a PDF a cryptographic checksum is produced which is based on the whole PDF document content and your private signing key This cryptographic checksum or digital signature is then embedded within the PDF As a result if even one bit of the PDF document changes perhaps by accident or perhaps by a malicious attacker then the digital signature will no longer be valid when verified As long as you protect your private PDF signing key then no one else can sign a PDF in your name Now if you have created an invisible PDF signature then the actual visible content of your PDF e g when you print the PDF to paper will show no indication that the PDF document was signed The embedded digital signature of the PDF has no visible characteristics it is purely an electronic PDF signature stored inside the PDF document Invisible PDF signatures are very useful where the document content MUST not change as a result of the signing process This is definitely needed in some business scenarios where the physical appearance of the document has to follow strict guidelines which must not be changed as part of signing process The only indication then that the PDF is signed is when it s viewed and verified inside a PDF signature compliant PDF reader e g The following screenshot shows an invisible PDF signature being viewed inside Ascertia PDF Sign Seal Visible PDF Signatures Visible signatures are PDF signatures which actually create a visible mark on the PDF page to indicate that the PDF signature has been applied this digital signature appearance is visible when the document is printed to paper The process of signing is very similar to before however before creating the PDF signature the visible signature appearance is stamped on the PDF and then the PDF is signed The following screenshot shows a visible PDF signature inside PDF Sign Seal Of course the PDF signature appearance is fully customisable and can have company logos hand signature images and various other text details Ascertia PDF signing software is at the leading edge of creating custom PDF signature appearance stamps and also provides great flexibility on how these are positioned on the PDF page All Ascertia datasheets and solution sheets are digitally signed and they are certified to protect against any data being added Certified PDF Signatures These are special PDF signatures which not only protect the document integrity and prove who signed the PDF document but also protect any further changes to the document E g a certified PDF document can be locked to prevent or control additional data being entered or appended Note these PDF signatures are often referred to as Certification Signatures Certified PDF signatures are particularly important where you want to present a PDF document or PDF form where the user can enter text only in specific areas So you can certify the document and lock its contents from change apart from allowing filling form fields and digitally signing in existing PDF blank fields This ensures that your end users will not edit the document in unwanted areas before returning to you It s important to note that a PDF certified signature must be the first signature on a PDF document I e a document that is already signed cannot later be certify signed The following screenshot shows how to configure PDF Sign Seal for certified signatures and the options available The following screenshots shows how PDF Sign Seal displays certified signatures Its interesting to note that certified PDF Signatures can be either visible or invisible PDF signatures Approval PDF Signatures This is a special name given to PDF signatures within ISO 32000 1 where the PDF signature is applied as part of an approval process after having certified a PDF document These approval PDF signatures are applied within existing blank signature fields inside the PDF document Multiple approval PDF signatures can be applied if multiple blank fields exist Advanced Long Term PDF Signatures and PAdES The need for long term PDF Signatures is described in more detail in this hot topic Basically such an advanced PDF signature not only creates a PDF signature but also embeds a cryptographic timestamp from a Time Stamp Authority TSA to prove at what time the signature took place and also the signer s certificate status to prove that the signer s key and certificate were valid at time of the signing The following diagram illustrates the process The following screenshot shows a long term PDF signature being verified in PDF Sign Seal Click here to download an example long term signed document it s our PDF Sign Seal datasheet see the signature appearance at bottom of page 2 All our datasheets are signed with long term advanced PDF digital signatures Note long term PDF signatures can be either invisible or visible PDF signatures Adobe CDS Signatures When verifying a PDF signature an important step is validating the signer s certificate to ensure it was issued by a trusted Certificate Issuer aka Certificate Authority or CA Within latest versions of Adobe Reader v7 Adobe by default only had its own Root CA as the final trust point This meant in order to automatically get your PDF signatures verified successfully and hence a green tick you needed a signing certificate which was issued by one of the recognised subordinate CAs authorised by the Adobe Root CA these included GlobalSign GeoTrust etc This ensured that your signing certificate chained to the Adobe Root CA Such certificates are called Adobe CDS certificates CDS stands for Certified Document Services Ascertia PDF Sign Seal and also ADSS Signing Server both support CDS certificates as standard Of course an alternative option to getting your PDF signatures trusted within Adobe Reader is to add the new CA to the list of trusted CAs We provide a brief note on how to configure this here This allows you to trust a preferred certificate authority however sometimes even making this simple one time configuration change in Adobe Reader is too much of a burden for end users and hence Adobe CDS certificate are valuable in such cases What is the Adobe Approved Trust List AATL Since Reader v9 Adobe now allows other CA s to be added to Adobe Root Trust Anchor list as final trust points Essentially both Acrobat and Reader have been programmed to reach out to a web page to periodically download a list of trusted root CA digital certificates Any digital signature created with a PDF signing certificate that can chain back to one of these CAs will be trusted by Acrobat and Reader 9 0 and above If you want to verify that the Trust List is enabled go to Edit Windows Acrobat Mac Preferences Trust Manager and be sure that the Load trusted root certificates from an Adobe server check box is checked You can click the Update Now button in that same dialog box to download the latest version of the Trust List from Adobe PDF Signatures Summary Signing a PDF is essential for protecting the document s integrity proving who has signed and approved the PDF data and when this PDF signature took place PDF signatures can be invisible or visible PDF documents can be locked with certified PDF signatures although approval signatures can still be applied to such documents if there are existing blank signature fields before the certified signature was applied Advanced PDF Signatures referred to as PAdES signatures with embedded trusted timestamps and signer certificate status information are essential for verifying PDF documents in the long term When verifying PDF signatures it is important to determine whether the PDF signing certificate chains to a final trust point or trusted CA There are three options 1 your certificate should chain to Adobe Root CA in this case you have a CDS certificate 2 your certificate chains to a third party CA and Adobe Reader has been configured to trust this CAs 3 your certificate chains to a CA which is part of the Adobe AATL program and you are

hunter gatherer once had We are living longer and longer lives and in the next decade several new technologies and procedures could extend our lives further Learn about just a few of the innovations that could save your life someday Remote Surgery Present Day Surgeons already perform some surgeries by controlling robotic arms from a nearby console The Idea Why can t surgeons do the same thing from farther away The Advantages Robotic surgery expected to cut deaths after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery from 10 to World class surgeons more accessible even in war zones from anywhere in the world The Next Step Improving connectivity and reducing transmission delays Genome Customized Medications Present Day More efficient methods of sequencing the human genome are utilized every day The Idea Medication can be diagnosed or even custom made based on an individual s genome The Advantages Diseases can be predicted and prevented decades before they appear Replacement of trial and error prescription with safer more effective drugs and dosages The Next Step Overcoming the challenges of finding specific genes affecting drug response More widespread pharmacogenomics expected in the next 4 years Catheter Based Renal Denervation Present Day Named the 1 Medical Innovation for 2012 by the Cleveland Clinic The Idea 40 minute procedure reduces blood pressure controls resistant hypertension and possibly helps treat insulin resistance chronic kidney disease and heart failure The Advantages 1 in 3 U S adults has hypertension 1 risk factor for death worldwide 30 reduction in cardiovascular mortality The Next Step Trials with more patients and longer follow up are required Nanomedicine Present Day Some drug delivery nanotechnologies are already in use The Idea Fabricating nanotechnology or controlling matter at a molecular scale can provide diagnoses target treatments for a broad range of diseases The Advantages Target tumor cells without the side effects of chemotherapy Remove barriers to the circulatory system and repair damaged tissues The Next Step Machines that can build nanoprobes are still 10 20 years away but drug delivery nanomedicine is further along New Cancer Detection Methods Present Day A sports bra in development can detect breast cancer up to 6 years before a tumor is visible The Idea Cancer detection systems that find cancer earlier and don t even require a doctor The Advantages Reduce the need for painful diagnostic procedures such as biopsies Handheld optical scan identifies 98 of melanomas The Next Step A breath test for lung cancer is 9 years away Urine tests for bladder cancer are 4 years away Wireless Body Monitoring Present Day FCC announced new measures to promote wireless health technology in September The Idea Monitoring the body wirelessly helps doctors patients intervene more quickly The Advantages Wireless radio pills log when patients take their medicine Blood pressure blood sugar calorie and weight data used as a tool for healthier living Wireless patches alert women when they re fertile The Next Step Cost is the biggest factor holding this research back Bone Regeneration Present Day Instead of grafting bone from the pelvis spine surgeons are applying bone growth factor to accelerate healing The Idea Stem cells and bone growth factor as new means of bone replacement The Advantages Alternative to bone fusions 30 40 of which don t heal Reduces risk of virus transmission and rejection from cadaver harvested bone grafts The Next Step Biological joint replacement still in testing stages New synthetic

year or so I have seen so many delicious recipes that contained browned butter and the idea of cooking butter until it darkens in colour and deepens in flavour has always appealed to me I have quite the love affair with butter as it is so this was not an out of character step for me I first tried it in a savoury dish when I developed a recipe for our cookbook Low Carbing Among Friends with fish topped by a browned butter sauce And oh it was just heavenly I am not going to share that recipe with you though Sorry folks but that one is in The Cookbook and will remain in The Cookbook only You will simply have to buy the book to get at it And speaking of The Cookbook I have a few pieces of news on that front Bear with me here The SOLD OUT first printing of the book has now been shipped to those who pre ordered it much earlier than expected Those of you who ordered your copy during the pre order process should be seeing it by December 7th at the latest If it doesn t arrive by then please be sure to email EUREKA PUBLISHING GMAIL COM with your order details If you plan on ordering your copy through Amazon several hundred copies are on their way and should be stocked by this weekend You will find Low Carbing Among Friends at http www amazon com shops eureka publishing This book has turned out to be such a hit in the low carb world that we are already planning Volume 2 and 3 and I and my collaborators will be contributing a whole new set of recipes along with expert advice for following a low carb diet Right now Volume 2 is planned for a July publishing date which means I need to get my butt in gear and start developing some great recipes for you I can t give away the whole deal but do expect some surprises and some new voices and experts for these upcoming volumes Our team leader Jennifer Eloff and our publisher Ian Eloff have been interviewed by Jimmy Moore for his amazing Livin La Vida Low Carb Show You can listen to the full interview at the following link Be sure to forward to the 37 minute mark because there is a previous interview in the first half http www thelivinlowcarbshow com shownotes 5439 515 dr lauren noel and jennifer ian eloff It s a wonderful interview and really gives some great background about the book the low carb lifestyle and our collaborative team as a whole For more information on the cookbook and how to order visit AmongFriends us Okay back to the joy that is browned butter Not only does it make a fantastic addition to savoury dishes but it s wonderful in baked goods as well I ve seen any number of cookies bars cakes and even icings made with browned butter and I decided I had to give it a go I wasn t quite sure what I wanted to do with it but these lovely Cocoa Nib Cookies caught my eye and I thought that a low carb version made with browned butter would be a good place to start I thought long and hard about how to make them what flours to include and how to make them hold together And I tried two ways of forming them one roll out version and one slice and bake version The Results First let me tell you that roll out cookies are the way to go with these no question In the absence of gluten the slice and bake approach just didn t work very well the dough log started to crumble apart even after a good length of time chilling in the fridge But rolling the dough out between sheets of parchment worked beautifully and they held together very well as I cut them with cookie cutters and lifted them out As for the cookie itself they are good but I think they need a little tinkering The deep brown butter flavour didn t come through as much as I would like and I fault the coconut flour Coconut flour absorbs so much liquid and in my personal opinion tends to overwhelm other flavours sometimes even when used in small quantities So the browned butter got lost here to my disappointment I think I need to increase the amount of browned butter and decrease the coconut flour but that may make them too fragile We shall have to see But I really do like the crunch of the cacao nibs and they way they add a nutty chocolate flavour without adding sweetness My kids loved these cookies though and fought over the heart shaped ones goodness knows why So in that regard they are a hit And they sure are pretty Browned Butter Cacao Nib Cookies Cookies 1 4 cup butter1 cup almond flour1 3 cup coconut flour1

whisk together almond flour coconut flour erythritol arrowroot starch baking powder xanthan gum salt and cacao nibs Add browned butter eggs vanilla and stevia extracts and stir until dough begins to come together It will still be somewhat crumbly but should hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand Turn out half the dough onto a sheet of parchment or waxed paper and use hands to form into a flattened disc Top with another sheet of parchment or waxed paper and roll out to 1 4 inch thickness Cut out shapes with cookie cutters and lay on prepared baking sheets Bake cookies 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned Let cool on baking sheets 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely For the chocolate drizzle place butter and chocolate together in a small microwave safe bowl Microwave on high at 30 second intervals stirring in between until smooth Use spoon to drizzle lightly over cooled cookies Let set for at least one hour Makes approximately 40 2 inch

information on medicines vitamins herbs and dietary and lifestyle changes that may be helpful About acne vulgaris Acne vulgaris also known as common acne is an inflammatory condition of the sebaceous glands of the skin It consists of red elevated areas on the skin that may develop into pustules and even further into cysts that can cause scarring Acne vulgaris occurs mostly on the face neck and back of most commonly teenagers and to a lesser extent of young adults The condition results in part from excessive stimulation of the skin by androgens male hormones Bacterial infection of the skin also appears to play a role Product ratings for acne vulgaris Science Ratings Nutritional Supplements Herbs Niacinamide topical Zinc Tea tree oil topical Guggul Pantothenic acid Vitamin A Vitamin B6 Burdock Vitex associated with menstrual cycle See also Homeopathic Remedies for Acne What are the symptoms Acne is a skin condition characterized by pimples which may be closed sometimes called pustules or whiteheads or open blackheads on the face neck chest back and shoulders Most acne is mild although some people experience inflammation with larger cysts which may result in scarring Dietary changes that may be helpful Many people assume certain aspects of diet are linked to acne but there is not much evidence to support this idea Preliminary research found for example that chocolate was not implicated 1 Similarly though a diet high in iodine can create an acne like rash in a few people this is rarely the cause of acne In a preliminary study foods that patients believed triggered their acne failed to cause problems when tested in a clinical setting 2 Some doctors of natural medicine have observed that food allergy plays a role in some cases of acne particularly adult acne 3 However that observation has not been supported by scientific studies Vitamins that may be helpful In a double blind trial topical application of a 4 niacinamide gel twice daily for two months resulted in significant in improvement in people with acne 4 However there is little reason to believe this vitamin would have similar actions if taken orally Several double blind trials indicate that zinc supplements reduce the severity of acne 567 8 In one double blind trial 9 though not in another 10 zinc was found to be as effective as oral antibiotic therapy Doctors sometimes suggest that people with acne take 30 mg of zinc two or three times per day for a few months then 30 mg per day thereafter It often takes 12 weeks before any improvement is seen Long term zinc supplementation requires 1 2 mg of copper per day to prevent copper deficiency Large quantities of vitamin A such as 300 000 IU per day for females and 400 000 500 000 IU per day for males have been used successfully to treat severe acne 11 However unlike the long lasting benefits of the synthetic prescription version of vitamin A isotretinoin as Accutane the acne typically returns several months after natural vitamin A is discontinued In addition the large amounts of vitamin A needed to control acne can be toxic and should be used only under careful medical supervision In a preliminary trial people with acne were given 2 5 grams of pantothenic acid orally four times per day for a total of 10 grams per day a remarkably high amount 12 A cream containing 20 pantothenic acid was also applied topically four to six times per day With moderate acne near complete relief was seen within two months while severe conditions took at least six months to respond Eventually the intake of pantothenic acid was reduced to 1 to 5 grams per day still a very high amount A preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 at 50 mg per day may alleviate premenstrual flare ups of acne experienced by some women 13 While no controlled research has evaluated this possibility an older controlled trial of resistant adolescent acne found that 50 250 mg per day decreased skin oiliness and improved acne in 75 of the participants 14 However another preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 supplements might exacerbate acne vulgaris 15 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual supplement for information about any side effects or interactions Herbs that may be helpful A clinical trial compared the topical use of 5 tea tree oil to 5 benzoyl peroxide for common acne Although the tea tree oil was slower and less potent in its action it had far fewer side effects and was thus considered more effective overall 16 One controlled trial found that guggul Commiphora mukul compared favorably to tetracycline in the treatment of cystic acne 17 The amount of guggul extract taken in the trial was 500 mg twice per day Historically tonic herbs such as burdock have been used in the treatment of skin conditions These herbs are believed to have a cleansing action when taken internally 18 Burdock root tincture may be taken in the amount of 2 to 4 ml per day Dried root preparations in a capsule or tablet can be used at 1 to 2 grams three times per day Many herbal preparations combine burdock root with other alterative herbs such as yellow dock red clover or cleavers In the treatment of acne none of these herbs has been studied in scientific research Some older preliminary German research suggests that vitex might contribute to clearing of premenstrual acne possibly by regulating hormonal influences on acne 19 Women in these studies used 40 drops of a concentrated liquid product once daily 20 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual herb for information about any side effects or interactions Holistic approaches that may be helpful Acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of acne Several preliminary studies have reported that a series of acupuncture treatments 8 to 15 is markedly effective or curative in 90 to 98 of patients 212223 Besides traditional Chinese acupuncture using needles alone a technique called cupping is frequently used in the treatment of acne Cupping refers to the use of cup shaped instruments to apply suction to the area being needled Two preliminary trials of cupping treatment for acne reported marked improvement in 91 to 96 of the study participants 2425 Controlled trials are necessary to determine the true efficacy of acupuncture and other traditional Chinese therapies in the treatment of acne Some hypnotherapists believe that hypnosis might help prevent facial scarring associated with acne In one case study a patient was instructed to say the word scar in place of picking her face and the scratch marks resolved The underlying acne was unaffected 26 References To view roll mouse over the References heading to hide click on the heading 1 Fulton JE Jr Plewig G Kligman AM Effect of chocolate on acne

ourselves outside our comfort zone to grow and stay sharp It is easy to become lazy and complacent However our brain and our body are a use it or lose it proposition Don t waste your potential We need to find ways to challenge ourselves with new activities and learning opportunities to live life to the fullest If you have something that makes you uneasy then face it head on Push yourself outside your comfort zone and you will beat all your fears Don t grow old gracefully Fight it every step of the way by seeking new ways to stretch yourself Here are some ideas to help get you started 1 Travel to a foreign country Take out a map and find a place you ve never been Plan a trip to a country that is unfamiliar to you It will stimulate your mind and your senses You will have the opportunity to pick up parts of a new language eat different foods and meet interesting people 2 Participate in a yoga class Yoga will stretch you very literally There are numerous benefits to yoga It will help you mentally physically and some say even spiritually It certainly will help you to relieve stress and become more physically fit If you are looking for ways to keep your body toned then a yoga class may be a good choice 3 Go on a solo backpacking trip There is something very stimulating about camping alone in the woods You are totally dependent on your own wits and skill A trip like this pits you against nature for comfort and sometimes survival The solitude will also give you time alone with your thoughts 4 Arrange a public speaking engagement Apparently speaking in public is a fear greater than death for some people This is one fear that everyone can conquer Why let something simple shackle you The key is to just do it Your local Toastmasters club would be happy to help 5 Audition for a role in a play Give your creative side a chance to come alive in the theater Were you in a high school production Why not give it a try again You might rediscover something about yourself that has been suppressed 6 Read a book with an opposing view We can all get set in our ways and our limited view of the world Pick up a book at your local library that purports a view that is contrary to one that you hold dear Read it from cover to cover and try to keep an open mind Note points that make some sense and ponder them 7 Change jobs I run into people all the time that seem to hate their jobs but they won t go out and find a better one Don t stay stuck in a rut any longer Take a step today toward finding a new position After all if you aren t happy now what do you have to lose 8 Volunteer to improve your community Volunteer opportunities abound These needs give us the chance to expose ourselves to things we won t normally see in our safe little lives It will expand our horizons and give us a greater appreciation for what we have In addition you might just make a difference in someone else s life along the way 9 Learn to scuba dive Find your local PADI certified training center and learn to be an Open Water Diver I was fortunate enough to do this myself recently It is a lot of fun and a bit of a challenge You will feel like a true explorer once you are certified 10 Dress up for Halloween Get yourself a costume and find yourself a Halloween party Express your inner child by dressing up and having some fun My wife and I did this last year and it was a complete hoot I highly recommend it as a way to bring yourself out of a shell 11 Take a dance class Dancing is great exercise a fun way to meet people and a fantastic way to creatively express yourself There are all kinds of dance classes that you can find to meet your individual tastes You might even meet a new friend in the process 12 Enroll in a college course Is it time to expand your knowledge in a particular area Maybe you need a way to spark new interest in a subject that has always intrigued you College courses are a great way to give yourself a new challenge while also expanding your opportunities 13 Introduce yourself to a complete stranger For some this is no big deal but for others of us this is not something that comes easily Set a goal to meet five new people this week What s the worst that can happen You might make a connection that will blossom into a fruitful relationship 14 Attend a service at the church of your choice Are you attending to your spiritual needs If not maybe it is time for you to seek out a place of worship Not sure where to go I would suggest asking a friend if you can accompany them It will make their day 15 Sit alone in complete silence for an hour This one sounds simple enough but give it a try It is harder than you think We are so accustomed to noise and to being in the presence of others that you might initially find this very challenging My guess is that if you do it for a few days that it will become something you love 16 Move to a new home Find a new place to live in a different city or at least on the other side of town A move will force you out of your ruts You will have to develop new routines and explore a new area This will give you a chance to grow and expand your boundaries 17 Go on an eco adventure Travel to Belize Costa Rica or another location that offers eco adventures The world is a big place and nature is full of fascinating creatures Get out there and see something new A trip like this is dangerous because it could change your entire life 18 Fly down a zip line Taking a zip line tour is a rush It will definitely get your adrenaline flowing I did this when I went to Puerto Vallarta Mexico earlier this year The zip line was total fun This type of thrill seeking awakens your adventurous spirit 19 Organize a reunion Reach out to some people that you haven t seen in awhile This could be family classmates or just an old friend that you haven t talked to in years Reminiscing about the past might stir up old ideas in you that you forgot you had 20 Write something and get it published Writing is a terrific way to express yourself and tap into your creativity Getting what you write published will give you a sense of accomplishment You will also probably get quite a nice boost from the positive reviews that you ll receive There is no excuse for remaining in your present rut A new challenge will energize you and give you the courage to continue to grow We only have one life to live and you do not want to waste another day Go stretch yourself outside your comfort zone What other ways are there to get out of our comfort zones Photo by stephcarter Related posts

moist Mocha Cupcakes with double the chocolate topped with another dose of luscious silky Chocolate Mousse Frosting I thought to myself Self if this doesn t satisfy your chocolate craving nothing will I feel like I ve earned a little indulgence These last few months have been hectic to say the least Recipe writing with a very sick computer caused a one week absence to turn into almost a 3 month absence My computer was holding me hostage Not only that but my phone went kaput at the same time Another famous saying When it rains it pours I m happy to report not only is my computer healthy again but I also finally have a new phone Now if only I could figure out how to use all the buttons The really hard part was that I so missed chatting with all of you I want to thank everyone that reached out to me during my absence It s a wonderful feeling knowing that you are missed I am looking forward to catching up with my fellow bloggers and also with all of you I ve submitted all the recipes for the book and am now to the editing stage I honestly wondered if I would ever get here And although the editing is usually drudgery to most people I m really happy to be here Maybe that s because the during the recipe development phase I was literally waking up baking and going to sleep baking I was dreaming of cakes pralines custards and mousse I guess there are worse things I could be dreaming of But when you re dreaming of taking a shower and instead of water coming through the shower head you re dreaming of chocolate pouring through it s time to hang up the apron and take a rest And that s exactly what I did over the last few weeks no baking no whisking no mixing and no beating And no chocolate I took the time to catch up with the kids family and friends It was to the point I was getting daily phone calls asking Are you done yet I wish I could say all was complete with the book but hopefully I ll be able to report that very soon I m also hoping things will quiet down a bit so I can get back on a normal schedule Even though I ve been crazy busy I wouldn t change this experience for anything It s been so much fun and I am so excited for the release of my very own cookbook

battered newsrooms can learn from stewart's cnbc takedown"",""body"":""The most talked about journalism of this week wasn t produced in the New York Times CNN Newsweek or NPR It was Jon Stewart s epic eight minute takedown on Wednesday night s Daily Show of CNBC s clueless in the tank reporting of inflatable bubbles and blowhard CEOs as the U S and world economies slowly slid into a meltdown You can quibble about Stewart s motives in undertaking the piece after he was spurned for an interview by CNBC s faux populist ranter Rick Santelli but you can t argue with the results The piece wasn t just the laugh out loud funniest thing on TV all week and this was a week in which NBC rebroadcast the SNL more cowbell sketch so that s saying a lot but it was exquisitely reported insightful and it tapped into America s real anger about the financial crisis in a way that mainstream journalism has found so elusive all these months in a time when we all need to be tearing down myths As one commenter on the Romenesko blog noted it s simply pathetic that one has to watch a comedy show to see things like this But that s not all The Stewart piece also got the kind of eyeballs that most newsrooms would kill for in this digital age planted atop many many major political media and business Web sites and the kind of water cooler chatter that journalists would crave in any age In a time when newspapers are flat out dying if not dealing with bankruptcy or massive job losses while other types of news orgs aren t faring much better the journalistic success of a comedy show rant shouldn t be viewed as a stick in the eye but a teachable moment Why be a curmudgeon about kids today getting all their news from a comedy show when it s not really that hard to join Stewart in his own idol smashing game Here s how 1 Great research trumps good access to the powerful The Stewart piece makes this controversial but critical point in two different ways For one thing the story shows how access to the nation s most powerful CEOs supposedly the big advantage of a journalistic enterprise like CNBC isn t worth a warm bucket of spit when it results in slo pitch softball questions for fear of offending the rich and powerful And so we see Ford s CEO grilled about Kid Rock s performance at the auto show Ponzi scammer later revealed Alan Stanford quizzed on whether it s fun to be a billionaire and Maria Money Honey Bartiromo gushing at how corporate chiefs were still telling her that their companies were doing great even as the massive iceberg was casting its shadow over the hull of the American economy Jon Stewart s act of journalism reported of course by his ace team of writers worked because there were no interviews at all It all hung instead on meticulous research dredging up lethal quips of CNBC s stock pumping hosts to hang them with their own undeniable words Jim Cramer s buy buy buy when the Dow was roughly double what it is today his touting of Bear Stearns and Bank of America s doomed stocks The kind of research that s so hard for most newspapers to do anymore with downsized staffs and ever looming deadlines but which can so often belies the spin from our accessible sources 2 The American public is mad as hell right now so why isn t the mainstream media Balanced reporting is important but a balanced modulated tone of voice Not now not when millions are hurting from lost jobs and under water mortgages and many millions more are living in fear of the same fate People need information but what they so desperately want an outlet that shares their passion and yes that rage and so Jon Stewart gave people what they weren t getting anywhere else 3 Tear down this wall of pretending that the media itself isn t a major player in American society and isn t a factor in most big stories Sure there were greedy bankers and their pocketed politicians working in unintended tandem to take the Dow from 14 000 down to 6 600 but these popular TV pundits were there every step of the way as The Daily Show revealed and their contribution was consequential Mainstream media after all these years has a hard time understanding that one of the major political forces in this country is mainstream media something the audience knows all too well 4 The First Amendment doesn t say anything about not being funny or not being passionate I don t know about you if you actually watched the piece but I feel like I learned something important confirming the cheerleading nature of the nation s most watched source for business news even in a moment of oncoming disaster but I also busted my gut laughing as I did And there s nothing wrong with that informing and entertaining at the same time isn t that what newspapers are charging people 75 cents for You know sometimes people do some crazy stuff when they realize their days are numbered I don t have the answers to problems facing American journalism not my own newsroom mired in Chapter 11 nor the others that face a possible death sentence But fighting for life will mean living each day like it was your last with passion anger and laughter the way The Daily Show shined a light on a crevice of

Comments You know when your parents and teachers told you to forget about trying to earn a living from playing sport and to knuckle down to your studies Well they were idiots We may be in the midst of a global economic meltdown but the world s top sports stars are still up to their necks in cash According to the Forbes list of celebrity wealth here are the 10 richest sports stars in the world today 10 Alex Rodriguez Baseball 34m per annum The New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez is the youngest player to have ever hit 500 home runs In 2007 A Rod signed a record breaking 10 year 275 million contract to become the highest paid player in baseball history The previous record was his existing contract with the Yankees which paid 252 million In total Rodriguez s career earnings from baseball alone stand at 197 431 586 Add to that his lucrative endorsements with the likes of Nike Rawlings and Topps and the 33 year old is sitting on a fortune Rodriguez divorced last year amidst claims of an affair with Madonna Following the split from his wife Cynthia A Rod placed their marital home on the market for 14 9 million though he has since dropped the price to 12 3 million This at least proves that the rich and famous aren t entirely impervious to the credit crunch but I think he ll get by 9 Roger Federer Tennis 35m per annum Roger Federer s ATP ranking may have slipped from world number 1 down to number 2 but Rafael Nadal still has some way to go before he can top the Swiss star in terms of earnings Having won 13 Grand Slam titles Federer has coined millions in prize money and has sponsorship deals with Nike Rolex and Gillette His marketing company have claimed that Federer is the wealthiest tennis player of all time and he has been named as one of the 300 wealthiest people in Switzerland an area where the neighbours tend to have a little dough Unlike some of his sporting contemporaries Federer has kept his feet on the ground In a 2007 interview with Sports Illustrated he admitted to not even owning a house 8 Ronaldinho Soccer 37m per annum Like Federer Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldinho has been upstaged by young upstarts such as Messi Ronaldo and Kaka in recent years but he s still sitting pretty from the days when he was widely accepted as the greatest player in the world Ronaldinho has enjoyed massive contacts with soccer giants Barcelona and present club AC Milan as well as commercial deals with Nike Pepsi and Cadbury Schweppes It is arguable that it has been the contentedness that comes with such wealth which has been responsible for Ronaldinho s loss of form Still at least the money has allowed an ugly guy like Ronaldinho to sleep with hundreds of beautiful women and live in this amazing house 7 LeBron James Basketball 38m per annum LeBron James was never going to be short of money from the day that he signed a 90 million contract with Nike before he d even made his professional debut LeBron was the first pick in the 2003 NBA draft joining the Cleveland Cavaliers At 24 years old married to his childhood sweetheart and a father of two clean cut LeBron is a marketing man s dream James has stated that he intends to become the world s first billionaire athlete The home he is currently building is certainly fit for a billionaire At 35 000 square foot it s certainly roomy Having knocked down the pre existing 11 bedroom house on the site LeBron s mansion will include a full size casino a six car garage and bowling alley 6 Kobe Bryant Basketball 39m per annum Kobe Bryant plays his basketball in Los Angeles and only a select few of Hollywood s great and good can claim to earn more than the Lakers shooting guard Bryant saw many of his endorsement deals ripped up after he was accused of rape in 2003 The exception was Nike who had just signed him to a 5 year 45 million contract prior to the incident In addition to this he is signed to a 6 year 71 million deal with the Lakers After the rape accusation Bryant bought his wife Vanessa a 4 million diamond ring as an apology It must be nice to get out of the doghouse so easily Most of us would be on dishwashing duty for at least a month 5 Kimi Raikkonen Formula One 44m per annum Kimi Raikkonen became the highest paid man in motor racing when he joined the Ferrari team in a three year deal and earned his money when he walked away with the Formula One World Drivers Championship in his first season The Finnish driver leads something of a playboy lifestyle and in 2005 got into trouble with his former employers on the McClaren team when he began cavorting with a lapdancer at a London club before embarking on his own strip show Raikkonen is now settled down and married to Jenni Dahlman a former Miss Scandinavia Well she would be enough to see anyone onto the straight and narrow 4 Phil Mickelson Golf 45m per annum If there was no one on earth named Tiger Woods then Phil Mickelson would undoubtedly be even higher up this list Mickelson picked up 10 million in prize money and 35 million in appearance and sponsorship fees Mickelson is something of a serial endorser having given his name to Ford Rolex and Callaway golf clubs amongst others He has earned far more off the course than on it but at least he spends his advertising bounty the right way In 2007 after hearing the story of retired NFL player Conrad Dobler and his family on ESPN explaining their struggles to pay medical bills Mickelson volunteered to pay for Conrad s daughter Holli s college education at Miami University in Ohio 3 Michael Jordan Basketball 45 m Michael Jordan edges ahead of Mickelson on this list despite earning roughly the same amount of money due to the fact that he has actually retired from professional sport These days Jordan works as head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats but the vast bulk of his income comes from royalties from the 800 million a year in sales of the Nike Jordan brand It s no wonder then that Jordan can be so free with how he spends his money In 2005 author Richard Esquinas claimed he had won 1 25 million from Jordan on the golf course In 2006 Jordan divorced his wife Juanita who received a 168 million settlement 2 David Beckham Soccer 50m David Beckham is a global marketing phenomenon Despite being a very good rather than truly great soccer player Beckham has amassed a huge fortune due to his film star looks Though Beckham s base salary with LA Galaxy was only 5 5 million the figure was more than doubled with his cut of the team s ticket merchandise and sponsorship revenues Add endorsements with Adidas Motorola and Pepsi to name just a few and Beckham has a huge yearly income Despite having recently signed a deal to spend much of his time playing on loan for AC Milan Beckham obviously sees a future in the US as he has recently stated that he might buy his own MLS franchise Beckham lives in a 22 million mansion in a gated community near to the home of Tom Cruise Unlike most famous sportsmen his wife actually earns money rather than just spending his In 2007 Victoria was paid 20 million for the Spice Girls reunion tour She is the 52nd richest woman in Britain 1 Tiger Woods Golf 115 m Eldrick Tont Tiger Woods has won 14 major golf championships and 65 PGA tour events Ranked as the number 1 golfer in the world Woods is thought by many to be greatest player of all time He s also one of the most marketable In 2000 he signed a 5 year 105 million contract with Nike which at the time was the largest endorsement deal ever made by an athlete Tiger also has deals with American Express Buick TAG Heuer and EA Sports amongst many others Woods company Tiger Woods Design creates golf courses around the world The Tiger Woods Dubai will open in September of this year and features a a 7 700 yard par 72 course a 60 000 square foot clubhouse a golf academy 320 exclusive villas and a boutique hotel with 80 suites There are further plans afoot to open golf courses in North Carolina and Kariba in Zimbabwe with the latter expecting to cost 608 million According to Golf Digest Woods made 769 440 709 from 1996 to 2007 and that by the end of the decade he will become the first athlete to have made over a billion dollars If LeBron James thinks he can really pip Tiger to that title then he d better start buying lottery tickets Below is the very modest clubhouse at the Tiger

necessarily mean quitting your job selling your worldly belongings getting off the grid and disconnecting from the rest of the world It certainly CAN mean that but it doesn t HAVE to That level of independence simply isn t practical for most of us SELF SUFFICIENCY PAIRED WITH COMMON SENSE Aside from housing and transportation food is the single most expensive necessity that most families have to deal with A recent USDA study indicates that the average monthly grocery cost for a family of four is somewhere between 500 and 700 This is far more than the cost of utilities like electricity and water style Learning and implementing self sufficient food skills can impact a families expenses far more and far quicker than just about anything else a family can do Installing solar or wind power generation units or buying a brand new green vehicle for example can certainly reduce your dependence on outside sources but the expense of doing so is extreme and the pay back is many years at best By comparison supplies for growing collecting and preserving your own food is far less expensive and the payback is much quicker almost immediate in some cases style That s not to say that these high tech high dollar items don t have an important role in today s society it s simply that it may not be practical or realistic for the average family struggling to make ends meet Technology will catch up and pricing will come down someday but as of today it s extremely difficult Self reliance can be achieved in more realistic ways and only to the degree that you are comfortable with HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES style buying fresh locally grown produce in bulk canning and freezing fresh foods for use all year growing your own vegetable garden planting your own fruit trees and berry plants raising your own poultry and small livestock for eggs and meat making you own wine beer cheese sausages sauerkraut pickles and other things collecting food from the wild like berries nuts mushrooms and greens catching fish and hunting wild game style YOU CAN LEARN TO BE MORE SELF RELIANT If you want to reduce your food budget have landed on hard times want to put up an emergency food supply or are just looking to eat a healthier diet I can help I ve spent most of my life learning ways to do these very things and I ll share those skills with you The more of these skills you learn for yourself the more self sufficient you become You have the chance to become the master of your own destiny as you and your family become less dependent on others My Grandpa used to put it in simpler terms He used to tell me Nobody takes care of your business like you do style Or stated another way Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life to mind your own business and to work with your hands so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody 1 Thessalonians 4 11 12style THERE S NO MAGIC TO IT style There s no magic in doing any of these things although it can seem pretty magical when you start enjoying the fruits of your own efforts People practice these types of skills every day all over the world Your grandparents or great grandparents probably practiced many of them during the Great Depression just to get by Mine certainly did If they could do it back then you can do it now All you need is motivation knowledge and resources My family passed their skills knowledge on to me It is my goal to pass it on further to as many people as possible Sadly it seems many of these skills are becoming lost as the older generations leave us

got a new camera this weekend There is always a period of adjustment with a new piece of tech and I only know what about half of the buttons do But I know how to take a photo with it so I thought I would make one of my favorite meals to try it out Mashed potato pizza is one of those things that you might think is weird or gross when you hear it but I promise it is really good It turns out that mashed potatoes and pizza are made to be together This was one of the best pizzas I ve ever had There is no tomato on this pizza In its place is a thick layer of garlicky buttery mashed potatoes I actually had mashed potato pizza for the first time in New Haven at a place called Bar but I ve sort of made the recipe my own and I think I might be able to give them a run for their money Mashed Potato Pizza The dough This makes two pizzas From Alton Brown s recipe 4 Cups bread flour 4 Tablespoons sugar 2 Tablespoons Kosher salt I probably used 1 3 4 The original is a bit salty 2 Tablespoons olive oil 2 Teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1 2 Cups lukewarm water Flour for dusting the pizza peel or baking sheet Olive oil for rising the dough Pizza 4 large potatoes enough mashed potatoes for 2 pizzas 4 cloves garlic 1 2 stick butter 1 2 cup milk or cream 3 Tablespoons olive oil 8 ounces of bacon per pizza 10 ounces mozzarella per pizza Broccoli Anything else that fits your fancy Helpful Equipment Pizza stone and peel Let s make the dough first Pizza dough is something that really needs to rest for a good amount of time to mature in flavor and get nice and elastic I typically like to make mine the day before I intend to cook To start combine the yeast salt sugar olive oil and water in a bowl Yeast soup Add your flour and bring all of the dough into a ball When it looks like the below you can start kneading it If you have a fancy mixer you can beat it with the paddle attachment for 10 minutes and save yourself a workout Before a 10 minute knead If like me you rely on pure brute strength to make awesome pizza then you ll need to knead this dough for at least ten minutes but probably closer to 15 Eventually it will become very smooth Then it is time to rise Pour a bit of olive oil in your bowl and lightly coat your ball of dough This will make sure it doesn t dry out Let it rise at room temperature for two hours This is active dough After the rise you can punch it down and cut it into two balls If you must you can use them right away but they will be much better if you let them chill in the fridge for at least a day They can keep for a few days though if you coat them in a bit of olive oil If you do put them in the fridge let them rise at room temperature for an hour before using them Now we need to make the toppings for this guy I m assuming you know how to make bacon crispy is better for this recipe You also probably know how to make mashed potatoes but if not just cut up the potatoes into cubes and boil them in lightly salted water for about 10 minutes until they fall apart when poked with a fork Then mash them up with the garlic cream or milk and butter I actually like mine a bit on the chunky side It gives the pizza a good texture Good ingredients Next preheat the oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone in it Forming a pizza takes a bit of practice If it is your first time go slow and be patient The dough is very forgiving if you made it correctly It will be very elastic Take a ball and roll it out into a circle With light pressure start working it from the inside out Once you feel comfortable feel free to pick it up and stretch it over your knuckles a bit It shouldn t rip if you keep it moving by lightly rotating it around your hand If you are feeling brave you can give it a toss Had a little photography help on this one Once you have a rough circle that is the size you want and the thickness that you want slap it on a pizza peel that has been dusted with corn meal or flour If you don t have a peel you can use a baking sheet The sheet just makes it a bit harder to slide it into the oven I used one for years though before I got a peel Feel free to make a decorative crust or just leave it flat Whatever makes you happy No need to do a crust but they are pretty easy Sprinkle a bit of olive oil over your dough Since we aren t using a sauce we need to add a bit of moisture on the bottom A sprinkle of oil Then lump on your mashed potatoes No need to spread them out evenly or anything They will flatten out while baking Also don t be stingy This is the base of the pie No need to go light on the potatoes Next

one byte at a time: once-obese teen writes weight-loss book inspired by concept of video games"",""body"":""By Daisy DumasLast updated at 10 41 PM on 21st October 2011 At just 14 years old Taylor LeBaron was addicted to video games and eating and weighed a shocking 297lbs Now 18 the teen has transformed his body and his life Over 18 months the teenager originally from Georgia lost half of his bodyweight turning his love of gaming into a motivational tool Chronicling his battle against childhood obesity Taylor last year launched a book Cutting Myself in Half 150 Pounds Lost One Byte at a Time aiming to set other children on the course to healthier lifestyles and away from obesity Halved weight Taylor LeBaron 18 has written a book about his extraordinary weight loss The teenager this week told CNN that at school he was targeted because of is size People just put me down for no real reason other then my weight issue The turning point came when Taylor had the shock of his life by standing on some weighing scales at age 14 297lb and I m 14 years old and I m alone in this room and I m like Oh my goodness I m not even an adult and I weigh nearly 300lbs He blames his massive weight at the time to a combination of factors A lack of physical exercise and physical activity I had a lifestyle choice of eating whenever whatever and however much of it as I want and I knew from that moment on that I gotta do something to take back my life Morbidly obese Taylor went from 297lbs to 147lbs shedding half of his body weight Challenge Taylor devised an extreme weight loss programme that he turned into a game mimicking the video games he loves As Taylor had been overweight since a very young age that meant making some massive and fundamental changes across his whole life His lifestyle plan starting immediately saw him drop junk food count calories and get more active including taking long walks and playing fewer sedentary video games I developed a plan that s based on videogame strategies the prize is a whole new lifestyle It wasn t an easy start his first time at the gym saw him ride an exercise bike for nine minutes and 48 seconds before the machine signalled a warning that kicked the teenage off But to help him along the way Taylor also devised a motivational game based on the video games he loved I developed a plan that s based on videogame strategies which I call the Ultimate Fitness Game because the prize is a whole new lifestyle Once I started playing UFG I never looked back In the next 18 months my weight dropped from 297 to 147 and it s the weight I ve maintained ever since Work out The Georgia native joined a gym to push his weight loss to the next level He now maintains a weight of less than 150lbs I ll be 19 next month and now if I stepped on the scale and saw my once dream weight of 190 I d panic because I d be more than 40 pounds over my normal weight the teen writes on the news site The result is Taylor s diet plan that he says is designed with teenagers lifestyles in mind and is realistic and achievable I think it s much easier to keep the weight off if you think of it as a lifestyle change not a diet Diet implies it s temporary He says his transformed life has opened up previously unimaginable opportunities to him As dreams came true I discovered bigger dreams I d never imagined I was selected as one of ten teens to carry the torch in the 2010 Winter Olympics he writes on CNN com Opportunity The teen says his dreams are coming true thanks to his new lifestyle He was selected as a torch bearer for the 2010 Olympics The criteria for the national contest were academics fitness community service and environmental concern Before getting fit I would have qualified in every area but one Taylor a freshman studying economics at Washington College in Chestertown Maryland is now a motivational speaker My goal is to be able to help other kids get their weight under control he told the channel It

won't)"",""body"":""If 80s movies taught us anything it s that at some point you re going to run into a mysterious relic that lets you switch bodies with other people Would you use it Would you choose to switch lives with say Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie or Dale DeBone Most people would But let s say the artifact doesn t let you choose but will instead switch you randomly with one of the other six billion people on the planet Virtually nobody will take that deal for fear they d switch with some poor villager in Nigeria So what does that say about us Well according to experts it says almost everything we think about what would make us happy is dead wrong Let s look at the five things we re most wrong about with some pictures of adorable animals for good measure Go to the little girls aisle at the department store if you re not there already On the shelves you ll see the dominant little girl fantasy isn t Cinderella or even Dora the Explorer It s Hannah Montana Playsets come complete with a camera makeup and a mirror for Hannah to admire herself in The girls play with that when they re eight and by 16 they re on MySpace pouting at the camera in their underwear and watching the friend requests pour in In a recent survey of high school kids 51 percent said their ultimate goal was to become famous This is brand new to humanity for thousands of years material goods and security dominated Now fame is at the top Obviously part of the reason is the perception that anybody can get famous these days reality TV and YouTube have proven that you can become a celebrity for doing not a goddamned thing But there s another less obvious factor And it explains why so many famous people are miserable So What s the Problem Experts say where you find kids who desperately want to be famous you find a history of neglect at home Parents were either absent completely or at best emotionally distant dicks It turns out the whole surge in aspirations for fame came right along with the explosion of single parents and broken homes Only half of today s children live with their original two parents You can see how this sad mechanism works in the attention starved mind The kid is programmed by biology to love a parent but the parent doesn t return the love Fame lets them turn the tables on that arrangement When you re famous millions love you but you don t even know their names It s purely one sided They wait for hours in the cold for your autograph you barely glance at them on the way to your limo You get to take their love and wipe your ass with it the same as your parents did to you I love you Your deaths would mean nothing to me But it turns out that kind of massive paper thin adoration is a poor substitute Famous people are four times as likely to commit suicide as the rest of us Hell you d think it d be higher everybody reading this has seen more than one of their favorite performers self destruct Wait it Gets Worse If you re saying that your parents were awesome and that fame still looks pretty freaking cool well we re not done Studies show nothing is more stressful for a human than when their goals are tied to the approval of others Particularly when those others are an enormous crowd of fickle strangers holding you up to a laughably unrealistic ideal built by publicists thick makeup and heavily Photoshopped magazine covers You could seek comfort from your circle of friends only now your friends have been replaced Invasion of the Body Snatcher s style with hangers on vultures unscrupulous characters and plain dumbasses who only want a piece of the spotlight even if it means selling you out later For example have you ever lit up a bong at a party Were you worried that one of your friends would snap a photo of you sell it to a tabloid for thousands of dollars and ruin your career Well become famous and then try it Let s not bullshit each other You see those ads on the side of the screen And at the top And at the bottom Go look at one of them We just made 800 baby Seriously they re set up to detect the position of your eyeballs If you actually click on one we make enough to fill our SnoCone machine with Cristal Most of us get out of bed everyday purely because it edges us one step closer to some kind of financial future we want If we won the lottery most of us would show up to the office the next day wearing an ankle length fur coat and enough bling to make Mr T look Amish and only stay just long enough to take a dump in our boss s inbox So What s the Problem Hey remember when we said earlier that most people wouldn t do the body switching thing for fear they d wake up in Nigeria Well according to surveys Nigerians are happier with their lives than the people of any other country Can your country fit three to a motorcycle Didn t think so The USA came in 16th Hey did we mention that the average Nigerian makes 300 a year That s less than a hundredth of what the average American makes America being the country that hands out 120 million prescriptions for anti depressants every year China is turning into a great object lesson in this as their economy explodes and incomes skyrocket but levels of happiness and personal satisfaction are dropping at the same rapid rate There s a couple of reasons for it First your brain adjusts feelings of happiness downward after you ve reached some goal or other It regulates the good feelings presumably so that you have motivation to reach the next goal instead of just lounging by the pool for the rest of your days The second one is that as social creatures we compare ourselves to our neighbors This is why executives can cry about the 500 000 salary cap that comes with taking government bailout money Their friends are making 3 million a year and live in igloo made out of cocaine We can laugh at their complaints but of course then you re giving the Nigerian permission to laugh at yours That guy made 100 times more than you you make 100 times more than the Nigerian Once you start hanging around the other high earners you ll want all the stuff they have No that s not right you ll want the stuff that s so much better than their stuff that they ll vomit with envy As one magazine for Wall Street bigshots put it you want the stuff that will be a huge middle finger to everyone who enters your home Yeah same model as yours Only covered in solid fucking gold But what about sudden wealth like if you won the lottery or sold your novel for 10 million That d be cool right because you d still remember your former life and appreciate your new riches Well just ask William Bud Post who wound up broken and bankrupt after he won 16 million in the lottery It turns out that while he knew how to handle the stress of being poor thanks to a lifetime of experience he had no concept of how to handle the new and alien stresses of wealth Wait it Gets Worse Remember the whole Invasion of the Body Snatchers phenomenon we talked about with famous people where suddenly all of your friends turn into leeches Same here only worse With your newfound riches suddenly friends pop up from all over Cousins who you ve never met forgotten classmates from school women who d never even look your way before all suddenly in your orbit complimenting you doing you favors Then they casually slip it into conversation that they re going to have to default on their mortgage unless somebody helps out Your very own entourage Suddenly every relationship is in doubt Do they actually care about you Or do they just want a seat on the Bling Train Would they sell you out to get to your cash That lottery winner we mentioned above somebody hired a hitman to take him out to get to his money That somebody was his own fucking brother We know all about this one first hand That old stereotype about how comedy writers and heavy Internet users tend to have bodies chiseled out of solid sex It s true One visitor remarked that the Cracked office Looked like a Manowar album cover came to life Office Christmas party 07 Yes being physically attractive has concrete advantages Attractive people earn more get better grades have better jobs and find more successful partners than average or ugly people Strangers are more likely to help them in a crisis They have wider social circles So What s the Problem Remember we re talking about happiness here not success For one attractive people have the same self esteem problems the ugly people do Like money attractiveness is relative and if you re hotter than your friends at that stage you start comparing yourself to people in the media You know like the magazine covers we mentioned before the ones that that have had the living shit Photoshopped out of them Before and After In other words they ve adjusted to the experience of being attractive the same as our high income earners have adjusted to having money they just pick other flaws to worry about Sure if you used the magical artifact up there to become Angelina Jolie tomorrow you d notice the difference over how you re treated now But if you were born Angelina Jolie you d have no way of grasping it the same as right now you don t realize what it s like to live life with some kind of horrible deformity if you do have a horrible deformity then you don t know what it s like to live with a worse one Work with us here Wait it Gets Worse You know how when the hot girl at the bar tells an unfunny joke all the guys laugh anyway Or when the office stud makes a mistake the female boss laughs it off Attractive people live in a world where most feedback they get is bullshit The compliments mean nothing they ve learned that s just the sound people make when they walk by That s why studies show they tend to dismiss the genuine compliments they get in other areas their work personality sense of humor creativity because it gets lumped in with the same counterfeit flattery they ve been getting their whole lives I

camera these shots don t come along often 50 Philadelphia Phillies Throwback Jersey With a curvaceous P on the front and a kelly green backdrop it s time to blow the mothballs off of this legendary masterpiece Solid hard nosed and pure Meet Pete Rose 49 Houston Aeros Away Jersey These designers have thrust their Aeros into the upper tier of the American Hockey League with this curious creation Aggressive yet elegant 48 Florida Panthers 3rd Jersey Blue and darker blue aren t exactly Panthers colors but this jersey as a whole reeks of solid domination On the other hand it also screams Pittsburgh Penguins 47 Pittsburgh Pirates Negro League Jersey There s nothing like Heritage Week to bring back the old days The Homestead Grays clearly believed in simplicity and class Less continues to be more 46 Edmonton Oil Kings Military Jersey This Western Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this mockery of NHL analyst and nut Don Cherry Risky business though as this can often be misconstrued as brutal 43 Atlanta Braves Throwback Jersey Worn by Hank Aaron and his pack of Braves during the franchise s first two seasons in Atlanta 1966 67 this simple off white piece of cloth is a pleasant vacation for the pupils With a player number replacing the chest high tomahawk and an iconic badge on the sleeve these jerseys present solid compliments to the everyday white and red 42 Montreal Canadiens Throwback Jersey When the Canadiens broke out their 1910 11 Centennial jerseys few were ready for such festive aggression An early Christmas present 41 Missouri Tigers New Jersey Forget the heart of a lion this Missouri squad is ready to prove they possess the mind of a Tiger Enhanced durability makes these cats ferocious 40 North Stars Jersey Minnesota enjoyed the green and yellow North Stars from 1967 to 1993 before they moved to Dallas and became the Stars Minnesota Wild 2000 present brass evidently decided not to follow suit 39 Pittsburgh Steelers Throwback Jersey If these 80th season jerseys truly are inspired by bumblebees then due credit goes to those talented honey dwellers They may be tough on the eyes but these obtuse jerseys are a refreshing and necessary addition to the NFL Only in doses though 38 France New Away Jersey The stripe work may seem excessive but let s be real You can never have enough stripes Just as long as France doesn t get mistaken for a pack of referees 37 Anaheim Ducks Quacky Jersey David Wright continues to amaze us with his potent disregard for the routine This is no regular Ducks sweater But it s clearly phenomenal 36 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey These 1912 1913 throwbacks give us another reason to love stripes But we re still searching for Waldo 35 Turkey New Away Jersey Simple yet effective is the direction these designers seemed headed for The edgy lettering and gnarly ray of light shining from the back makes this potent presentation almost magical 34 Halifax Mooseheads Jersey The firm red shoulders pads curved lettering and complimentary script are the main ingredients for artistic brilliance The CHL is simply epic 33 California Golden Seals Jersey One of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion the California Golden Seals never truly grasped the importance of winning on the ice they moved to Cleveland and became the Barons in 1976 They were clearly more focused on keeping their elegant white skates squeaky clean 32 Tampa Bay Lightning 3rd Jersey Released in 08 these silver trimmed knockouts are subtly intense It s refreshing The diagonal style lettering is a slight but necessary detail 31 Miami Heat Orange and Pink Jersey They only played in the ABA for two years 1968 1970 but that didn t keep today s superstars from remembering the Miami Floridians White pink orange black It might be too festive Though never too unique 30 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 3rd Jersey Not only does the centerpiece bird look like a steroid struck or murderous version of Daffy Duck but he also appears ready to dominate the ice They re far from traditional and far from boring 29 Connecticut Whale Jersey Since 2010 this AHL uniform has dominated the competition The Hartford Whalers esque feel gives the Whale a mighty advantage on camera 28 Los Angeles Kings Throwback Jersey This purple and yellow elegance has rarely let down the illustrious Lakers so perhaps the Kings should turn back the clock and embrace their retro look Beating the Devils for the massive Stanley Cup would be a memorable first step to a new tradition 27 Maryland Terrapins New Jersey If the checkered oddly shaped new Maryland jerseys don t get your senses riled up perhaps their gold alternates will Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a refreshing clean cut addition to the often cliched gridiron fashion business Letter circling on the helmet makes this a knockout 22 Rutgers Scarlet Knights New Jersey Underneath this fresh style is an exuberant smile unable to contain itself Oh yes look closely The Scarlet Knights seem ready for battle 21 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey Word has it that this blue masterpiece was only worn for one year 1909 1910 but man what a year it was Time for a comeback 20 England New Away Jersey Rugby is already grueling enough but with a duel kit like this few others have a chance The staredown is classic 19 New York Rangers Heritage Jersey 18 Memphis Grizzlies Throwback Jersey As our eyes steadily adjust to the vibrant presentation it becomes clear that the Memphis Grizzlies have an intricate plan for victory Pleasantly distract all viewers 17 France New Home Jersey A ferocious blue display is perfectly complimented by slight gold lettering on the chest and sleeves Nike s new France home kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay necessary tribute 15 New York Mets Throwback Jersey It seems the Mets have finally realized the atrocity surrounding their black uniforms A legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic tops Muggles may not possess the power to soar on broom sticks but they clearly know what it takes to look good 13 Oakland Athletics Throwback Jersey Just picture mustache extraordinaire Rollie Fingers sporting the green and yellow stirrups Truly kicking it old school 12 Chicago Blackhawks Throwback Jersey This 1936 inspired sweater does everything to escape the norm The tribal logo sets the tone while the cream white and red striping puts the finishing touches Epic 11 Texas Rangers Throwback Jersey This 1976 powder blue home uniform rests officially as one of the best to have ever graced the diamond The colorfully striped rims are a nice touch 10 Detroit Red Wings Throwback Jersey During their Cougar days Detroit s beloved franchise fashioned an intricate yet clean arsenal This eye pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented their spot in sports lore with five George Mikan led championships and vibrant suits Perfection 5 Great Britain New Olympics Jersey Thank you Leicester Riders forward and national team captain Andrew Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top during LeBron James days but not so much this retro piece The 1970 s wine and gold look is a keeper 3 Ohio State Buckeyes Throwback Jersey In honor of the 1954 Buckeyes team the Ohio State football team was seen repping these artistic keepers at Michigan Stadium several years back From the intricate sleeve work to the simple yet engaging helmets these uniforms epically compliment the gridiron 2 Golden State Warriors Throwback Jersey A faint blue and red trimming cements this less is more masterpiece in hardwood lore for good Purely classic 1 Brooklyn Dodgers Throwback Jersey What a brilliant shot for all Dodgers fans only in California of course The 1940 s road alternates help

Spiderman sensing the tingle of his spidey sense I ve been beckoned to help a family being torn apart by a culinary crisis The trouble centers around a Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Pie a current featured dessert from our local grocery store Wegmans According to my sister in law several battles have already ensued over the last piece of this dreamy creamy pie Even worse there will come the day when Wegmans switches over to its seasonal pumpkin pie leaving this poor family sorrowfully crying over the supermarket dessert case No no This will not do I must devise a suitable recipe to replicate this family s beloved treat First I need to know what we re going after So I went down to the grocery store to purchase one of these battle worthy pies According to my son who is a master of imagination the grocery store is ridden with wolves Luckily his younger brother was around to save his day and we left unharmed with the pie in hand Hmmm Chocolate wafer crust smooth moussey peanut butter filling a layer of chocolate pudding that was a surprise fluffy whipped cream peanut butter drizzle peanut butter cup chocolate curls Better taste it again to make sure I m not missing some important detail Is that a bit of vanilla Let me just check Alright I think I ve got it Seriously I deserve some sort of hazard pay for this stuff Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Pie Ingredients For the Crust 2 cups Chocolate Wafer Cookies crushed 1 stick Unsalted Butter melted For the Dark Chocolate Pudding 1 2 cup Sugar 1 3 cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder 3 Tbsp Cornstarch 1 8 tsp Salt 1 1 2 cup Whole Milk 1 2 cup Heavy Cream 3 oz Semisweet or Bittersweet Baking Chocolate chopped 1 tsp Vanilla Extract For the Peanut Butter Filling 3 4 cup Peanut Butter 1 8 oz bar Cream Cheese softened to room temperature 1 cup Confectioner s Sugar divided 2 1 2 cup Heavy Cream For the Peanut Butter Drizzle 1 8 cup Peanut Butter 1 4 cup Corn Syrup For the Garnish Mini Chocolate Chips Mini Peanut Butter Cups The easiest way to crush the cookies is to place them in a ziploc bag and roll a rolling pin over them until they are completely crushed Directions For the Crust Preheat oven to 350 degrees Combine the cookie crumbs with the melted butter Press the mixture onto the sides and bottom of a deep pie shell Bake for 8 minutes Remove from the oven and cool completely For the Pudding In a saucepan mix together sugar cornstarch cocoa and salt Whisk in 1 cup of milk stirring until combined Whisk in the remaining 1 2 cup of milk and 1 2 cup of cream Continue whisking over medium heat until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken about 5 minutes Whisking constantly continue cooking for another minute or two Be careful to whisk into the corners and along the sides of the pan Remove from heat Whisk in the chopped chocolate and vanilla stirring until fully melted Allow the pudding to cool at room temperature stirring frequently to prevent a skin from forming Meanwhile prepare the peanut butter filling For the Peanut Butter Filling In a large bowl over an ice bath beat 2 1 2 cups of heavy cream with 1 3 cup confectioner s sugar until stiff peaks form Keep the mixture cool over the ice bath In a separate bowl beat together peanut butter cream cheese and 2 3 cup confectioner s sugar until evenly combined Fold in 1 2 cup of the whipped cream to lighten the mixture Then gently fold in another 1 2 cup whipped cream just until combined The mixture should be light and fluffy Keep the remaining whipped cream cool over the ice bath or in the fridge For the Peanut Butter drizzle Combine peanut butter and corn syrup Mix to combine To Assemble the Pie Spoon the peanut butter filling into the cooled pie crust Refrigerate for about 15 minutes to set the mixture Pour the cooled pudding over the peanut butter filling Refrigerate for about 15 minutes to set the pudding Spread the remaining whipped cream over the top of the pudding Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips Drizzle with the peanut butter mixture Garnish with a mini peanut butter cup Refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the pie to cool completely Now I have to be honest with you There s a reason why there s not a lovely picture of a perfect slice of peanut butter heaven When I cut the pie and tried to plate a pretty slice it became a peanut butter pudding and cream mess The pudding was the real issue I substituted 2 milk instead of whole and as a result of a minor toddler crisis I didn t cook it as long as it should have cooked to properly thicken If you follow the recipe as written you shouldn t have this problem This is the same pudding recipe I wrote for the Chocolate Covered Pretzel Squares a month or so ago Cooked as written it s a thick dark chocolate pudding firm enough to stand up to slicing So do I as say not as I did and you should be golden Hey sis You know where to find your pie Better hurry Edited to add After having that first tricky piece of pie removed and a few more hours of chilling in the fridge it was much easier to slice and serve Here is a pic of the chocolate peanut buttery treat chocolate peanut butter cream pie"",""url"":""thegourmandmom 2010 08 13 chocolate

constantly bombarded with tips to keep our health in check But before drowning in diet soda and daily showers reassess some of these behaviors that may be doing more harm than help Foods and eating habits 1 Enhanced water A little faux fruity flavor might seem like a great way to up H2O intake but flavored water like Vitamin Water or even Smart Water can be filled with sugar Skip the artificially sweetened water and infuse water with actual fruit 2 Granola and granola bars Granola is made from whole grains so it can t be bad right Not so fast Granola and granola bars are both calorically dense and often contain a ton of sugar You may as well eat a candy bar 3 Protein bars Protein bars don t fall far from the granola bar tree They are often ultra high in calories and sugar not exactly what the body needs after a hard workout Choose a healthier high protein snack instead 4 Vitamins and supplements Multiple studies have shown that taking vitamins in pill form may not have any positive effect on long term health Researchers have surveyed the nonexistent or even potentially harmful ties of vitamin E and C supplements with heart disease cancer and cancer treatment Plus most people get all the vitamins they need from their food and substituting pills for whole foods may mean missing out on the benefits from other compounds found in the natural sources 5 Light beer News flash Light beer doesn t necessarily mean less calories Instead many simply have a lower alcohol content And for those interested in getting a buzz on the calorie difference may be negated by the need to drink more Sip a healthier beer instead and split up the six pack between friends 6 Low fat foods Think twice before skipping the fat filled salmon While cutting some fat could help weight loss we may miss out on some big benefits from healthy omega 3 fats such as boosting brainpower and lowering the risk of heart disease 7 Skipping meals Skipping meals probably won t save us any calories in the long haul Forgoing a meal may result in overeating later on so choose a healthier lunchtime treat instead 8 Bottled water Some bottled water may be filled with bacteria or chemicals when bottled in plastic containers So grab a water filter and purify tap water instead 9 Passing on dessert Don t deny your favorite dessert If really craving that double chocolate brownie enjoy a few generous bites instead of going for seconds at the dinner buffet line which could rack up even more calories 10 Diet soda Diet Dr Pepper may not be our friend Scientists suggest too much of these zero cal beverages could do as much damage as the sugary stuff potentially leading to weight gain and an uncontrollable sweet tooth The solution Skip the soda completely and opt for a healthier choice 11 Juice diets Many of us could use a few more fruits and veggies but we don t need to have spinach apple juice for breakfast lunch and dinner Juice diets may leave out important nutrients and enough calories to stay strong throughout the day 12 Microwave diet meals Try making your own meals without the box and frozen plastic tray Many frozen meals are packed with sodium while lacking veggies and enough calories Short on time Make a large batch of your favorite meal over the weekend and freeze individual portions to eat throughout the week Hygiene and health 13 Hot tubs They may be super relaxing but hot tubs are a one stop shop for bacteria and germs and may even cause a rash Gross 14 Antibacterial soap It may not be worth scrubbing down with the fancy stuff Regular soap and water is just as beneficial when it comes to staying squeaky clean 15 Brushing right after every meal Just cause dessert was devoured doesn t mean we should grab the toothbrush and paste Wait at least 30 minutes after a meal so saliva can neutralize the acid in the mouth and strengthen the enamel on those chompers 16 Avoiding the sun While too much sun could cause a nasty burn or worse sidestepping the sun at all costs may lead to a lack of Vitamin D which is essential for proper muscle and bone development 17 Daily showers Stop the scrubbing Hopping in the shower too often may irritate and dry out skin If you really need to freshen up spray on some perfume or cologne and save the shower till tomorrow 18 Catching up on sleep We re sorry to break it to you but it s pretty tricky to catch up on sleep So rather than skimping on sleep in order to cash them in later aim for a solid seven to nine hours a night 19 Sitting up straight Yeah we re surprised too Sitting up straight may be bad for the back so skip the seat and try a standing desk at the office 20 Cleaning with disinfecting products There s some evidence that certain chemicals in disinfecting products could lead to asthma Simply use a regular cleaning product or detergent without the chemicals instead Working out 21 Only doing cardio Hitting the roads is great and all but don t retire the weights for the running shoes Make sure to strength train to burn fat lean out and look badass in the process 22 Doing a million crunches The secret to six pack abs probably isn t crunch after crunch To flatten out and tone up the core try running some intervals lifting a few weights and cleaning up that diet instead 23 Breathing deeply through the chest Whether running the final lap or heading down the basketball court avoid deep breathing with the chest For a most effective breath to help any athlete s performance remember to use the diaphragm 24 Static stretching pre workout When warming up static stretching aka holding positions for a certain length of time won t do much in way of preventing soreness Skip the still motions and do dynamic stretches like lunges and high knees instead 25 Lifting machines Most lifting machines focus on single joint exercises which fail to improve muscle imbalance and does not burn as many calories as hitting the squat rack or swinging a kettlebell 26 Hitting the gym daily Don t get us wrong exercise is important But spending too much time at the gym leaves little time for muscles and the mind to recover Make sure to get at least one or two days of rest and dominate those dumbbells the rest of the week getty images from magazine headlines to wise words from our mother, we're constantly bombarded with \""tips\"" to keep our health in check. but before drowning in diet

in reality was quite twisted Having a kicker currently holding the NCAA record for longest kick 62 yards you wouldn t think a coach would be worried about wind conditions However Mornhinweg elected to kick thinking having the wind at their backs would give the Lions an advantage The Bears would go on to kick the game winning field goal before the Lions ever touched the ball on offense The coin toss

With two outs Ruth bolted for second but was thrown out by a mile ending the series and handing the Cardinals the title The 1926 World Series is the only one to end on a player caught stealing to this day 47 White Sox Wear Shorts in Game Yes this actually happened Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck had his players wear shorts for Game 1 of a doubleheader with the Kansas City Royals in 1976 What was he thinking Apparently he wanted to show everyone how fun he could be as an owner Maybe next time just hand out bobbleheads Bill 46 Billy Donovan Is Orlando Magic Coach for a Total of Five Days After becoming a success at the University of Florida Billy Donovan thought he wanted a new challenge in coaching in 2007 and agreed to a contract with the Orlando Magic of the NBA However just five days later Donovan said sorry to the city of Orlando and admitted making a mistake Donovan then returned to the Florida Gators to the tune of 3 5 million per year His decision to leave Florida in favor of the NBA still makes Gators fans wonder where his loyalty lies 45 US Congress Gets Involved in Steroid Use in Baseball Don t you think that is a little drastic For the United States government to get involved with steroids in the game of baseball The decision by the US Congress to investigate steroids in baseball was an unprecedented choice It is rare any issue in sports escalates to a hearing at this level What was the motive Was this really necessary Not likely 44 Twenty Teams Pass on Randy Moss In 1998 the focus of the NFL draft was the duel between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf for the No 1 overall pick So much buzz was generated by the QBs that everyone passed on a wide receiver with legal baggage However Randy Moss would prove the doubters so wrong and to this day the 20 teams that passed on him missed out on one of the highest ranked TD catching receivers in NFL history 43 Tim Donaghy Takes a Cue from Pete Rose NBA referee Tim Donaghy from 2005 to 2007 engaged in

sentence lost his job lost his wife and probably drinking his own tears because he can t afford to buy water 42 Park Si Hun over Roy Jones Jr at 1988 Olympics At the 156 pound Gold Medal match in

three judges voting for Si Hun were banned from judging for two years following the incident Photo courtesy of Sports Illustrated 41 Scott Walker Walks After Sucker Punch on Bruins Aaron Ward In the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs the highly touted Bruins would eventually lose Game 7 to the Hurricanes on a winning goal from Scott Walker the same man who sucker punched Boston defenseman Aaron Ward in Game 5 and received only a misconduct penalty The lack of suspension for the haymaker allowed Walker to put the Bruins away by scoring a goal that wouldn t have been if a worthy suspension had been handed down 40 Isiah Thomas and the Knicks From 2003 to 2008 Isiah Thomas traded for high priced mediocre players used high draft picks to select no major talents still in the NBA and ordered his players to commit dirty fouls in the paint which led to a brawl with the Denver Nuggets Thomas was let go in shame and replaced but left his mark on a dark era for the New York Knicks 39 Leon Lett Dives on Blocked Field Goal All the Cowboys had to do after blocking the potential game tying field goal from the Miami Dolphins was just let the ball lie But somehow here comes Leon Lett sliding across the snow to touch the ball and give the Dolphins a touchdown Lett had no idea what was going on and made a bone headed play created a technical fumble and a Dolphins victory 38 Miracle on Ice Russian Coach Benches Star Goalie After First Period A rag tag bunch of amateur hockey players were scraped together to represent the United States in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid N Y The decision by Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov to pull star goalie Vladislov Tretiak may have been the key to the US defeating heavily favored Russia The hockey game would be remembered by the US for decades to come including a Hollywood depiction of the game 37 Tiger Woods Should I Do This Commercial Attempting to make a statement Tiger Woods put out a questionable commercial with Nike addressing his critics The commercial was downright annoying and Tiger s game still hasn t improved following the fallout of the sex addiction scandal that caused a split with his wife and left thousands of hookers still waiting for their settlement money 36 Don Denkinger Blows Call in 1985 World Series It was Game 6 of the 1985 World Series between the St Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals KC s Jorge Orta tapped a grounder to first and Cardinals first baseman Jack Clark received the ball and flipped it to pitcher Todd Worrell covering first Umpire Don Denkinger called Orta safe although television replays showed he was clearly out The call is blamed for swaying the momentum of the series which the Royals eventually won 35 Roger Clemens Rafael Palmeiro Mark McGwire Etc Denying Steroid Use Things are so much harder when you try to cover up what everyone else already knows The decision to lie about steroids in front of the US Senate destroyed reputations exposed role models as money and power hungry machines and changed the face of baseball bitterly for an entire era 34 Bill Belichick Quits on the Jets After One Day In 1999 Bill Parcells resigned as the head coach of the New York Jets paving the way for another member of the coaching staff to take over A press conference was set up to officially introduce Bill Belichick as Parcells successor However just minutes before Belichick s scheduled acceptance speech the coach scribbled a resignation note on a small piece of paper and handed it to team President Steve Gutman When it was time for Belichick to take the podium instead of an acceptance speech he delivered a half hour speech on why he would not accept the position citing differences and uncertainties with ownership Most see the real reason for his departure being the available head coaching position with the New England Patriots a team that had just fired Pete Carroll In fact the Jets filed for compensation with the league saying the Patriots did not have permission to speak to him and the league ruled the Patriots would have to give the Jets a first round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft Who knows how different the NFL would have been had Belichick stayed with the Jets He finished his first season with the Patriots at 5 11 but everyone knows where it went from there This decision started the countdown on a down period for the Jets who were left with no coaches and shattered thoughts of what could have been 33 No Salary Cap in Baseball Most professional leagues have a limit to the amount of money any one team is allowed to have and spend on players But in Major League Baseball there is no cap on team spending just luxury taxes for pennies on the dollar Anyone else tired of seeing this image The decision to not place a cap on team spending hits this list with ease 32 Tiki Barber Leaves Football for TV Career In 2006 the New York Giants all time leading rusher announced he was hanging up his spikes in favor of a microphone Tiki Barber called it quits in the NFL at the age of 31 vowing to make a name for himself off the field He became a correspondent for NBC s The Today Show The Giants missed out on years of further success the NFL missed out on a potential Hall of Fame candidate and Barber drifted into the unknown never to be the same 31 Randy Moss Returns to the Vikings From day one Randy Moss just didn t settle well with the Minnesota Vikings Chemistry is such an important aspect to team sports and Moss was destined to cause a violent reaction when he returned This season following being waived less than a month after returning Moss surfaced in reports alongside head coach Brad Childress exposing issues in the locker room and a nasty tirade aimed at the team caterer Childress nearly lost his job after it was revealed he waived Moss without consulting the team owner While the Vikings are struggling mightily in 2010 the last thing they needed was a distraction like Randy Moss 30 Ricky Williams Wears Wedding Dress on Cover of ESPN Magazine When Ditka drafted Williams the parody was instantaneous Ditka gave up all the Saints draft picks in 1999 to get him so a marriage was in order However Ricky Williams
